<h2>FOREWORD</h2>


<p>Time, though a good Collector, is not
always a reliable Historian. That is to say,
that although nothing of interest or importance
is lost, yet an affair may be occasionally
invested with a glamour that is not wholly
its own. I venture to think that Piracy has
fortuned in this particular. We are apt to
base our ideas of Piracy on the somewhat
vague ambitions of our childhood; and I
suppose, were such a thing possible, the
consensus of opinion in our nurseries as
to a future profession in life would place
Piracy but little below the glittering heights
of the police force and engine-driving.
Incapable of forgetting this in more mature
years, are we not inclined to deck Her (the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg&nbsp;viii]</a></span>
&ldquo;H&rdquo; capital, for I speak of an ideal), if not
in purple and fine linen, at least with a lavish
display of tinsel and gilt? Nursery lore
remains with us, whether we would or not,
for all our lives; and generations of ourselves,
as schoolboys and pre-schoolboys, have
tricked out Piracy in so resplendent a dress
that she has fairly ousted in our affections, not
only her sister profession of &ldquo;High Toby
and the Road,&rdquo; but every other splendid and
villainous vocation. Yet Teach, Kid, and
Avery were as terrible or grim as Duval,
Turpin, and Sheppard were courtly or whimsical.
And the terrible is a more vital
affair than the whimsical. Is it, then, unnatural
that, after a lapse of nigh on two
centuries, we should shake our wise heads
and allow that which is still nursery within
us to deplore the loss of those days when
we ran&mdash;before a favouring &ldquo;Trade&rdquo;&mdash;the
very good chance of being robbed, maimed,
or murdered by Captain Howel Davis or
Captain Neil Gow? It is as well to remember
that the &ldquo;Captains&rdquo; in this book
were seamen whose sole qualifications to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg&nbsp;ix]</a></span>
title were ready wit, a clear head, and,
maybe, that certain indefinable &ldquo;power of
the eye&rdquo; that is the birth-right of all true
leaders. The piratical hero of our childhood
is traceable in a great extent to the
&ldquo;thrillers,&rdquo; toy plays, and penny theatres
of our grandfathers. Here our Pirate was,
as often as not, a noble, dignified, if gloomy
gentleman, with a leaning to Byronic soliloquy.
Though stern in exterior, his heart
could (and would) melt at the distresses of
the heroine. Elvira&rsquo;s eyes were certain to
awaken in his mind the recollection of
&ldquo;other eyes as innocent as thine, child.&rdquo; In
short, he was that most touching of all beings,
the Hero-cum-Villain. And it was with a sigh
of relief that we saw him at the eleventh hour,
having successfully twitted the &ldquo;Government
Men&rdquo; and the Excise (should he have an
additional penchant for smuggling), safely
restored to the arms of the long-suffering
possessor of the other eyes.</p>

<p>Alas! this little book mentions no Poll
of Portsmouth, nor does it favour us with
a &ldquo;Yeo, heave, oh!&rdquo; nor is there so very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg&nbsp;x]</a></span>
much &ldquo;cut and thrust&rdquo; about it. It was
written in that uninspiring day when Pirates
were a very real nuisance to such law-abiding
folk as you and I; but it has the merit of
being written, if not by a Pirate, at least by
one who came into actual contact with them.
I am not at all sure that &ldquo;merit&rdquo; is the
right word to use in this instance, for to be
a Pirate does not necessarily ensure you
making a good author. Indeed, it might
almost be considered as a ban to the fine
literary technique of an Addison or a
Temple. It has, however, the virtue of
being in close touch with some of the happenings
chronicled. Not that our author
saw above a tithe of what he records&mdash;had
he done so he would have been &ldquo;set a-sun-drying&rdquo;
at Execution Dock long before he
had had the opportunity of putting pen to
paper; but, as far as posterity was concerned,
he was lucky in his friend William
Ingram&mdash;evidently a fellow of good memory
and a ready tongue&mdash;&ldquo;who,&rdquo; as our author
states in his Preface, &ldquo;was a Pirate under
Anstis, Roberts, and many others,&rdquo; and who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg&nbsp;xi]</a></span>
eventually was hanged in good piratical
company on the 11th of June, 1714.</p>

<p>The actual history of the little book, the
major part of which is here reprinted, is
as follows:</p>

<p>Its full title is &ldquo;The History and Lives
of all the most Notorious Pirates and their
Crews,&rdquo; and the fifth edition, from which
our text is taken, was printed in 1735. A
reproduction of the original title-page is given
overleaf.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the title is misleading.
How could a book that makes no mention
of Morgan or Lollonois be a history of <em>all</em>
the most notorious Pirates? It deals with
the last few years of the seventeenth century
and the first quarter of the eighteenth, a
period that might with justice be called
&ldquo;The Decline and Fall of Piracy,&rdquo; for
after 1730 Piracy became but a mean
broken-backed affair that bordered perilously
on mere sea-pilfering.</p>

<span class="caption" style="font-size: small">[<a href="#text01">Transcription of text</a>]</span>
</div>

<p>A little research into the book&rsquo;s history
shows us that it is consistent throughout, and
that it is a &ldquo;piracy,&rdquo; in the publisher&rsquo;s sense
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg&nbsp;xiii]</a></span>
of the word, of a much larger and more pretentious
work by Captain Charles Johnson,
entitled, &ldquo;A General History of the Pyrates
from their first Rise and Settlement in the
Island of Providence to the Present Time;
With the Remarkable Actions and Adventures
of the two Female Pyrates Mary
Read and Anne Bonny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was published in London, in 8vo.,
by Charles Rivington in 1724. A second
edition, considerably augmented, was issued
later in the same year, a third edition in the
year following, and a fourth edition&mdash;in
two volumes, as considerable additions in the
form of extra &ldquo;Lives,&rdquo; and an appendix
necessitated a further volume&mdash;in 1725.</p>

<p>This two-volume edition contained the
history of the following Pirates: Avery,
Martel, Teach, Bonnet, England, Vane,
Rackham, Davis, Roberts, Anstis, Morley,
Lowther, Low, Evans, Phillips, Spriggs,
Smith, Misson, Bowen, Kid, Tew, Halsey,
White, Condent, Bellamy, Fly, Howard,
Lewis, Cornelius, Williams, Burgess, and
North, together with a short abstract on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg&nbsp;xiv]</a></span>
the Statute and Civil Law in relation to
&ldquo;Pyracy,&rdquo; and an appendix, completing the
Lives in the first volume, and correcting
some mistakes.</p>

<p>The work evidently enjoyed a great
vogue, for it was translated into Dutch by
Robert Hannebo, of Amsterdam, in 1727,
and issued there, with several &ldquo;new illustrations,&rdquo;
in 12mo. A German version by
Joachim Meyer was printed at Gosslar in
the following year, while in France it saw
the light as an appendix to an edition of
Esquemeling&rsquo;s &ldquo;Histoire des Avanturiers,&rdquo;
1726.</p>

<p>But little is known of the author, Captain
Charles Johnson, excepting that he flourished
from 1724 to 1736, and it is more than
probable that the name by which we know
him is an assumed one. It is possible that
his knowledge of Pirates and Piracy was
of such a nature to have justified awkward
investigations on the part of His Majesty&rsquo;s
Government.</p>

<p>There is one thing that we do know for
certain about him, and that is that the worthy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg&nbsp;xv]</a></span>
Captain&rsquo;s spelling, according to the pirated
version of his book, was indefinite even for
his own day. He was one of those inspired
folk who would be quite capable of spelling
&ldquo;schooner&rdquo; with three variations in as many
lines. In this edition the spelling has been
more or less modernized.</p>

<p>Lastly, it is to be remembered that the
ships of this period, according to our modern
ideas, would be the veriest cockle-shells, and
so that we should know what manner of
vessel he refers to in these pages, I had
recourse to a friend of mine whose knowledge
of things nautical is extensive enough
to have gained for him the coveted &ldquo;Extra
Master&rsquo;s Certificate,&rdquo; and who was kind
enough to supply me with the following

<h2>THE LIFE OF CAPTAIN AVERY</h2>


<p>He was the son of <i>John Avery</i>, a victualler
near <i>Plymouth</i>, in <i>Devonshire</i>, who in a few
years was grown as opulent in his purse as
in his body, by scoring two for one; and
when he had so done, drinking the most of
the liquor himself. By which means, and
having a handsome wife, who knew her business
as well as if she had been brought up to
it from a child (which, indeed, she mostly
was, her mother keeping the House before
she married <i>Mr. Avery</i>), they soon became
very rich and very able to give credit to a
whole ship&rsquo;s crew upon their tickets, which
in those days were sold for less than half
their value.</p>

<p>Having but one child (afterwards the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg&nbsp;4]</a></span>
Captain), they at first resolved to bring him
up a scholar, that he might advance the
dignity of the family. But instead of learning
his book, he was taught by such companions
that he could soon swear to every
point of his compass, which was a very
diverting scene for the Boatswain and his
crew, who were then drinking in the kitchen,
having just received ten pounds apiece short
allowance money on board the <i>Revenge</i>,
every farthing of which they spent before
leaving the house.</p>

<p>But as soon as their money was spent,
they were all like to have been imprisoned
by their Landlady for a riot, as she called it,
so they were soon glad to sheer off, and he
thought himself happiest that could get first
aboard. Indeed, it would have been happy
for them if they had, for the ship was unmoored
and gone to sea; which put the
Boatswain and his crew swearing in earnest,
and not knowing what to do, they resolved
to return to their Landlady, <i>Mrs. Avery</i>,
at &ldquo;the Sign of the <i>Defiance</i>.&rdquo; But she
shut them out of doors, calling them a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg&nbsp;5]</a></span>
parcel of beggarly rascals, and swearing that
if they would not go from the door she
would send for the Constable; and notwithstanding
all the entreaties and tears of her
only son, who was then about six years of age,
she could not be prevailed upon to let them
in, so they were obliged to stroll about the
street all night. In the morning, spying the
ship at anchor, being driven back by contrary
winds, they resolved to make the best of
their way aboard; but on the way, whom
should they meet but young <i>Avery</i>, who
had no sooner seen them, but he cried after
them. &ldquo;Zounds,&rdquo; says the Boatswain, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s
take the young dog aboard, and his mother
shall soon be glad to adjust the reckoning
more to our satisfaction before she shall
have her son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was agreed upon by all hands, and
the boy was as willing as any of them. So,
stepping into the boat, in about an hour&rsquo;s
time they reached the ship, which they had
no sooner boarded but they were brought
before the Captain, who, being in want of
hands, contented himself with bidding them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg&nbsp;6]</a></span>
all go to their business; for the wind turned
about, and there was occasion for all hands
to be at work to carry out the ship.</p>

<p>All this while young <i>Avery</i> was at the
heels of the Boatswain, and was observed to
swear two oaths to one of the Boatswain&rsquo;s;
which being soon observed by the Captain,
he inquired who brought that young rascal
aboard.</p>

<p>To which the Boatswain replied that he
did, that the boy&rsquo;s mother was his Landlady
on shore, and he had taken him up in jest,
but was afraid that they would now have to
keep him in earnest.</p>

<p>When the hurry was a little over, the
Captain commanded the boy to be brought
to him in his cabin. He had not talked long
to him before he took a fancy to him, telling
him that if he would be a good boy, he
should live with him.</p>

<p>He, being a mighty lover of children,
would often divert himself by talking to the
boy, till at length he took such a fancy to him,
that he ordered him a little hammock in his
own cabin, and none were so great as the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg&nbsp;7]</a></span>
Captain and his boy <i>Avery</i>, which had like
to have proved very fatal to him; for Avery
one night, observing the Captain to be very
drunk with some passengers that were on
board, got a lighted match and had like to
have blown up the ship, had not the Gunner
happened accidentally to follow him into
the store-room. This made the Captain
ever after very shy of his new Acquaintance,
and <i>Avery</i>, after he had been well whipped,
was ordered down into the hold, where he
remained until they arrived at <i>Carolina</i>,
which happened four or five days after.</p>

<p>The boy was given to a merchant, who,
taking a fancy to him, put him to school; but
he made so little progress in learning, and
committed so many unlucky tricks, that the
merchant, in about three years, shipped him
off to his friends at <i>Plymouth</i> on board the
<i>Nonesuch</i>, where he was no sooner arrived
but his mother was overjoyed with the sight
of her son, his father being dead about a
month before his arrival.</p>

<p>And, indeed, it was thought the loss of
their son broke his heart, for it was observed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span>
the father never held up his head after, the
neighbours often reflecting upon him for his
ill-usage of the seamen, who had spent so
much money at his house; saying he could
never expect that all his ill-gotten riches
could prosper him, which so happened, as
you shall hear presently. For his mother,
dying soon after, the boy was left under
the guardianship of one Mr. <i>Lightfoot</i>, a
merchant, who, having great losses at sea,
became a bankrupt, and so young <i>Avery</i>
was left to look out after himself; there he
continued for many years in pilfering and
stealing till the country was too hot for him,
when he betook him to sea again, where in
time he became as famous for robbing as
<i>Cromwell</i> for rebellion.</p>

<p>He entered himself on board the <i>Duke</i>,
Captain <i>Gibson</i> Commander, being one of
the two ships of twenty-four guns and one
hundred men which were fitted out by the
merchants of <i>Bristol</i> for the service of <i>Spain</i>,
which they had no sooner done, but they
were ordered by their agents at <i>Bristol</i> to
sail for the <i>Groyne</i> to receive their orders.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span>
On board one of which ships <i>Avery</i>,
being at this time above twenty years old,
entered himself, where he had not been long
before he observed the Captain was much
addicted to drunkenness.</p>

<p>He endeavoured to spirit up not only his
own ship&rsquo;s crew, but having also given the
word to part of the other ship&rsquo;s crew, the
conspirators gave the signal.</p>

<p>At which the <i>Duchess</i>, as the other ship
was named, put off her longboat; which
the conspirators hailing were answered
by the men in the boat, &ldquo;Is your drunken
Boatswain on board?&rdquo; This being the
word agreed upon, Avery answered,
&ldquo;All is safe;&rdquo; upon which twenty lusty
fellows came aboard and joined them,
which they had no sooner done but they
secured the hatches and went to work,
putting to sea without any disorder, although
there were several ships in the bay, amongst
whom was a frigate of forty-four guns.</p>

<p>The Captain, by this time being awaked
by the noise of the conspirators working
the ship, rung the bell, inquiring what was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg&nbsp;10]</a></span>
the matter, to whom <i>Avery</i> and some of the
crew replied, &ldquo;Nothing. Are you mutinous
in your cups? Can&rsquo;t you lie down, sleep,
and be quiet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; saith the Captain. &ldquo;I am sure
something&rsquo;s the matter with the ship. Does
she drive? What weather is it? Is it a
storm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Saith <i>Avery</i>: &ldquo;Cannot you lie quiet while
you are quiet? I tell you all&rsquo;s well; we are
at sea in a fair wind and good weather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At sea,&rdquo; saith the Captain; &ldquo;that can&rsquo;t
be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be not frightened,&rdquo; saith Avery, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;ll tell you. You must note, I am now the
Captain of the ship; nay, you must turn
out, for this is my cabin, and I am bound
for <i>Madagascar</i>, to make my own fortune
as well as my companions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Captain, being more terrified than
ever, did not know what to say, which <i>Avery</i>
perceiving, bid him take heart. &ldquo;For,&rdquo;
saith he, &ldquo;if you will join me and these
brave fellows, my companions, in time you
may get some post under me. If not,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg&nbsp;11]</a></span>
step into the longboat and get about your
business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This the Captain was glad to hear, but
yet began to expostulate with them upon
the injustice of such doings. Saith <i>Avery</i>:
&ldquo;What do I care? Every man for himself.
Come, come, Captain, if you will go, get
you gone; the longboat waits for you, and
if there be any more cowards in the ship,
you may all go together.&rdquo; Which words so
affrighted the whole crew, that there was
not above nine or ten of them that durst
venture, who made the best of their way to
the shore as fast as they could, and thought
they were well off.</p>

<p>The Captain was no sooner gone, but
they called a Council, which agreed to
own <i>Avery</i> as their Captain; which he
accepted of with all humility imaginable,
seeming to excuse himself on account of
his inexperience at sea. But he did it so
artfully that it more confirmed them in the
good opinion of their choice. &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;what we have done we must live
or die by; let us all be hearty and of one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg&nbsp;12]</a></span>
mind, and I don&rsquo;t question but we shall
make our fortune in a little time. I propose
that we sail first to <i>Madagascar</i>, where we
may settle a correspondence, in order to
secure our retreats, whenever we think fit
to lie by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To which they all agreed, &ldquo;Nemine contradicente.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But hold,&rdquo; saith <i>Avery</i>; &ldquo;it is necessary
that we make some order among us, for the
better governing of the ship&rsquo;s crew.&rdquo; Which
were in a few days drawn up by the clerk of
the ship.</p>

<p>And <i>Avery</i> promising them vast things,
they all came into them at last, although
some things went very much against the
grain of many of them.</p>

<p>It took up all their spare time till they
arrived at <i>Madagascar</i>, where they saw a
Ship lying at the N.E. part of the Island,
with which the men had run away from <i>New
England</i>; and seeing <i>Avery</i>, they supposed
that he had been sent after them to take
them, but <i>Avery</i> soon undeceived them, and
promised them protection; therefore they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span>
resolved to sail together. In the whole company,
there was not above ten that pretended
to any skill in navigation; for <i>Avery</i> himself
could neither write nor read very well,
he being chosen Captain of the <i>Duke</i> purely
for his courage and contrivance.</p>

<p>In the latitude of <i>Descada</i>, one of the
Islands, they took two other sloops, which
supplied them with provisions, and then they
agreed to proceed to the <i>West Indies</i>;
and coming to <i>Barbadoes</i>, they fell in with
a ship for <i>London</i> with twelve guns, from
which they took some clothes and money,
ten barrels of powder, ten casks of beef, and
several other goods, and five of her men, and
then let her go. From thence he went to
the Island of <i>Dominico</i>, and watered; there
he met with six <i>Englishmen</i>, who willingly
entered with <i>Avery</i>. They stayed not long
before they sailed for the <i>Granada</i> Island to
clean their ships; which being known to
the <i>French</i> Colony, the Governor of <i>Martenico</i>
sent four sloops well manned after
them. But they stayed there not long, but
made the best of their way for <i>Newfoundland</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>
entering the harbour of <i>Trepasse</i> with
black colours, drums beating, and trumpets
sounding.</p>

<p>It is impossible to relate the havoc they
made there, burning all before them. When
they left <i>Newfoundland</i> they sailed for the
<i>West Indies</i>, and from thence to the Island
<i>Descada</i>, it being judged the most convenient
place, at that time of the year, to meet with
a rich booty.</p>

<p>From hence they steered towards the
<i>Arabian</i> Coast, near the River <i>Indus</i>, where,
spying a sail, they gave chase. At their near
approach she hoisted <i>Mogul</i> colours and
seemed as if she would stand upon her
defence, whilst <i>Avery</i> contented himself by
cannonading her at a distance, which made
many of his men begin to mutiny, thinking
him a coward.</p>

<p>But <i>Avery</i> knew better, and commanding
his sloops to attack her, one in the Bow,
and the rest on the Quarter, clapt her on
board, upon which she struck her colours
and yielded. Aboard her was one of the
<i>Mogul&rsquo;s</i> own daughters, with several persons
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span>
of distinction, who were carrying rich offerings
of jewels and other valuable presents
to <i>Mecca</i>; which booty was the more considerable,
because these people always travel
with great magnificence, having all their
slaves and attendants always with them,
besides jewels and great sums of money to
defray the charges. But <i>Avery</i>, not content
with this, seized the young Princess, and
taking her with him into his own ship,
made the best of his way to <i>Madagascar</i>,
where she soon broke her heart and died.
Also her father, the <i>Great Mogul</i>, did no
sooner hear of it but he threatened all
<i>Europe</i> with revenge. And when he knew
they were <i>Englishmen</i> who had captured
his daughter and robbed him, he threatened
to send a mighty army, with fire and sword,
to extirpate all the <i>English</i> from their settlements
on the <i>Indian</i> Coasts, which gave no
small uneasiness to the <i>Indian Company</i> at
<i>London</i>, when they heard of it.</p>

<h2>CAPTAIN JOHN RACKHAM, AND HIS CREW</h2>


<p>John Rackham was Quarter-Master to
<i>Vane&rsquo;s</i> Company, till <i>Vane</i> was turned out
for not fighting the French Man-of-War,
and <i>Rackham</i> put in Captain in his place,
which happened about the 24th day of
<i>November</i>, 1718. His first cruise was
among the <i>Caribbe</i> Islands, where he took
and plundered several vessels. Afterwards,
to the windward of <i>Jamaica</i>, he fell in with
a <i>Madeira</i> Man, which he detained till he
had made his market out of her, and then
restored her to her Master, suffering <i>Hosea
Tisdel</i>, a tavern-keeper at <i>Jamaica</i>, whom he
had taken among his Prizes, to go aboard
her, she being bound for that Island.</p>

<p>Afterwards he sailed towards the Island
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>
<i>Bermuda</i>, where he took a Ship bound to
<i>England</i> from <i>Carolina</i>, and a small Ship
from <i>New England</i>, both which he carried
to the <i>Bahama Islands</i>, and there clean&rsquo;d.
But staying too long in that Neighbourhood,
Captain <i>Rogers</i> sent out a Sloop well
mann&rsquo;d, which retook both the Prizes, the
Pirate making his Escape.</p>

<p>From hence they proceeded to the Back
of <i>Cuba</i>, where <i>Rackham</i> staid a long Time
with his Delilahs, till their Provision was
consumed, when he concluded it Time to
look out for more. As he was putting
to Sea, a <i>Garda del Costa</i> came in with a
small <i>English</i> Sloop, which he had taken
as an interloper on that coast. The
<i>Spaniards</i> seeing the Pirate, attacked her;
but finding he could not come to her that
night, because she lay close behind a little
island, he warps into the channel, to make
sure of her in the morning. Upon this
<i>Rackham</i> took his Crew into the Boat, with
their pistols and cutlasses, and falls aboard
the <i>Spaniards</i> in the night, without being
discovered, telling them, if they spoke a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span>
word they were dead men: And so shipping
their cables, drove out to sea, commanding
them to take the Boat, and go
aboard their Sloop immediately, or else they
were all dead men. Afterwards they waking
the Captain and his men in the Hammocks,
who rose full of their expectation of the
Prizes, they sent them aboard their empty
Sloop.</p>

<p>In the Beginning of <i>September</i>, they went
off of the French part of <i>Hispaniola</i>, where
they took two or three <i>Frenchmen</i> on board,
that were looking after some cattle grazing
near the waterside. Then plundered two
Sloops, they returned to <i>Jamaica</i>, where
they took a Schooner.</p>

<p><i>Rackham</i> continuing about this Island
longer than a Man of his business ought
to have done, gave time to a Canoe, which
he had surprised in <i>Ocho</i> Bay, to inform
the Governor of <i>Jamaica</i> of his civilities
to all he met with going or coming from
the Island. Thereupon a Sloop was sent
out in quest of him, well mann&rsquo;d and arm&rsquo;d,
under Captain <i>Barnet</i>, to repay him for all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span>
his good-natured Actions, and, if possible,
to bring him into the Island. In the mean
Time <i>Rackham</i> met, near the <i>Negril</i> Point,
a small Pettiauger, which, upon sight of
him, ran ashore, and landed her Men; but
<i>Rackham</i> hailing them, desired the Pettiauger&rsquo;s
men to come aboard him, and
drink a bowel of punch; swearing, <em>They
were all Friends and would do no Harm</em>.
Hereupon they agreed to his Request, and
went aboard him, though it proved fatal to
every one of them, they being nine in all.
For, they were no sooner got aboard, and
had laid down their muskets and cutlasses,
in order to take up their pipes, and make
themselves merry with their new acquaintance
over a can of Flip, but Captain
<i>Barnet&rsquo;s</i> Sloop was in sight, which soon put
a damp to all their merriment: Finding she
stood directly towards them, they immediately
weighed their anchor and stood off.
<i>Barnet</i> gave them chase, and having the
advantage of the wind, soon came up with
her, gave her a broadside or two, and, after
a very small dispute, took her and his nine
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg&nbsp;23]</a></span>
new guests, and brought them all together
into <i>Port-Royal</i> in <i>Jamaica</i>, in about a fortnight&rsquo;s
time.</p>

<p><i>November</i> the 10th, 1720, a Court of
Admiralty was held at <i>St. Jago de la Vega</i>,
where the following Persons were tried and
convicted of Piracy, and accordingly Sentence
of Death was passed upon them by the
Governor, viz.: <i>John Rackham</i>, Captain;
<i>George Fetherstone</i>, Master; <i>Richard Corner</i>,
Quarter-Master; <i>John Davis</i>, <i>John
Howel</i>, <i>Patrick Carty</i>, <i>Thomas Earle</i>, <i>James
Dobbin</i>, and <i>Noah Harwood</i>; Five of whom
was hang&rsquo;d the next day at <i>Gallows-point</i>,
and the rest the day after. The three first
were taken and hanged in Chains; <i>Rackham</i>
at <i>Plumb-point</i>, <i>Fetherstone</i> at <i>Bush-key</i>, and
<i>Corner</i> at <i>Gun-key</i>.</p>

<p>But what was yet more strange was the
conviction of the nine guests, that knew
nothing of the matter, or at least they pretended
so; but the People would not believe
them, because it was proved that they came
on board with pistols and cutlasses: However,
they were so much favoured as to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span>
have the Court adjourned to the 24th of
January following, to give a better Account
of themselves than at the time appeared
to the Court: Beside, the Jury also then
wanted sufficient evidence to prove the
piratical intention of going aboard the said
Sloops. The two <i>Frenchmen</i> taken by
<i>Rackham</i> from the Island of <i>Hispaniola</i>,
deposed, That <i>John Eaton</i>, <i>Edward Warner</i>,
<i>Thomas Baker</i>, <i>Thomas Quick</i>, <i>John Cole</i>,
<i>Benjamin Palmer</i>, <i>Walter Rouse</i>, <i>John Hanson</i>,
and <i>John Howard</i>, came on board the
Pirate&rsquo;s Sloop at <i>Negril Point</i> in <i>Jamaica</i>.
Indeed they owned, That at first Sight of
them, they run away from <i>Rackham&rsquo;s</i> Sloop,
but that he hailing them, they returned, and
<i>Rackham</i> sent his canoe ashore to fetch
them aboard him, when they saw them all
armed with guns and cutlasses, which they
brought with them; and that when they were
chased by Captain <i>Barnet</i>, they were frank
and free, some drinking and walking about
the deck not at all dispirited; during which
time there was a great gun, and small
arms, fired by the Pirate Sloop at Captain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span>
<i>Barnet&rsquo;s</i> Sloop; but that they could not say
that the Prisoners were any way concerned
in it: However, they were certain that when
Captain <i>Barnet&rsquo;s</i> Sloop fired at <i>Rackham&rsquo;s</i>,
the Prisoners at the Bar went under
Deck, for cowardice, as they supposed;
not so much as once peeping up during the
time of the whole action: But when
Captain <i>Barnet</i> drew nigh to them to board
them, all of them came up, and helped to row
the sloop, in order to escape from him:
And that <i>Rackham&rsquo;s</i> Men and they seemed
to agree very well together, and that they
did verily believe they were all of a Party,
having heard them say, when they came on
board, <em>They liked them never the worse for
being Pirates, since they were all honest Boys,
and loved their Bottles</em>.</p>

<p>To which the Prisoners answered, in their
own Defence; That they were a great way
off from friends and acquaintance, and,
therefore it was impossible to have any one
to give an account of them. That they
were very honest pains-taking men, and
came out to go a-turtling to provide for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span>
their families; accordingly going ashore at
<i>Negril</i> Point they saw a Sloop, with a
white pendant, making towards them,
whereupon they took up their arms, which
were no other but what all people carry
upon such occasions, and ran into the
woods, to hide themselves among the
bushes, not knowing what she might be.
But when they hailed them and told them
they were <i>Englishmen</i>, they ventured out,
and came aboard them, as they desired, to
drink a bowl of punch, they being poor
men, who get their livelihood very hardily,
and such a thing was very acceptable to
them. But when they came on board the
Sloop, to their very great surprise, they found
they were Pirates; upon which they begged
to be released; but <i>Rackham</i> swore, That if
they did not stay and assist them against
that Sloop that was coming down against
them, he would cut all their throats. So
being compelled thereunto by <i>Rackham</i> and
his men, to save their Lives, they did assist
him, and with no other design but to prevent
their being cut in pieces, but as soon as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span>
Captain <i>Barnet</i> came up with them, they all
very readily and willingly submitted.</p>

<p>This being all they had to say in their
own Defence, the Prisoners were ordered
from the Bar: The Court were divided in
their Judgments; but the majority were of
opinion, that they were all guilty of the
Piracy and Felony they were charged with;
thereupon they all received Sentence of
Death, as usual in such cases, the Judge
making a very pathetic Speech to them,
exhorting them to bear their Sufferings
patiently, assuring them, that if they were
innocent, which he very much doubted, then
their reward would be greater in the Other
World: But everybody must own their case
was very hard in this.</p>

<p>February the 17th, <i>John Eaton</i>, <i>Thomas
Quick</i>, and <i>Thomas Baker</i>, were accordingly
executed at <i>Gallows-Point</i>; and the
next Day, <i>John Cole</i>, <i>John Howard</i>, and
<i>Benjamin Palmer</i>, underwent the same fate
at <i>Kingston</i>. The other three got a Reprieve,
they being against going aboard the
Pirate&rsquo;s Sloop, and are now living.</p>

<h2>CAPTAIN SPRIGGS, AND
HIS CREW</h2>


<p><i>Spriggs</i> sailed at first with <i>Lowe</i>, and came
away with him from <i>Lowther</i>. Afterwards
<i>Lowe</i> took a ship of twelve guns on the
Coast of <i>Guinea</i>, called the <i>Delight</i>, which
<i>Spriggs</i> went off on board with twenty men,
and leaving <i>Lowe</i> in the night, came to the
<i>West Indies</i>. In their passage they made a
Black Ensign, which they called the <i>Jolly
Roger</i>, with a skeleton in the middle holding
a dart in one hand, striking a bleeding
heart; and in the other an hour-glass; and
being hoisted, they fired all their guns to
salute <i>Spriggs</i>, whom they chose Captain,
and then went to look out for prey.</p>

<p>In their voyage they took a <i>Portugueze</i>
barque, wherein they had rich plunder.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg&nbsp;32]</a></span>
Near <i>St. Lucia</i>, they took a Sloop belonging
to <i>Barbadoes</i>, which they first plundered, and
then burnt, forcing some of the men into
their Service, and beating, in a barbarous
manner, those that refused to join with
them, and afterwards sent them away in
the Boat, half dead with their wounds, the
rest got to <i>Barbadoes</i>, with much ado, though
some of them died soon after of their cuts and
slashes. After this they took a <i>Martinico</i>
Man, which they used in like manner, save
that they did not burn the ship. Then running
down to the Leeward, they took one
Captain <i>Hawkins</i> coming from <i>Jamaica</i>, laden
with Logwood; out of which, they took her
stores, arms, and ammunition, and what
they did not want they threw over-board;
they cut the cables to pieces, knocked down
the cabins, broke the windows, and did
what mischief they could, taking <i>Burridge</i>
and <i>Stephens</i>, the two Mates, and some other
Hands, by force; and then after keeping
her a week, they let her go. On the 27th
they took a <i>Rhode</i> Island Sloop, compelling
the Captain, and all his men, to go on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span>
board the Pirate: One of them not being
willing to stay with them, they told him he
should have a discharge presently, which
was to receive ten lashes from every man
on board.</p>

<p>The next day <i>Burridge</i> signed their
Articles; which pleased them so much,
that they fired all the Guns, and made him
Master, spending that day in rejoicings and
drinking healths.</p>

<p>The First of <i>April</i> they spied a sail, and
gave her chase all night, believing she had
been a <i>Spaniard</i>; but when they came up
to her, and gave her a broadside, she cried
out for Quarters, which made them cease
firing, and ordered the Captain to come
aboard, which proved to be Captain <i>Hawkins</i>,
whom they had dismissed three days before,
not worth a groat. Two Days after, they
anchored at <i>Ratran</i>, not far from <i>Honduras</i>,
and put ashore Captain <i>Hawkins</i>, and several
others, giving them powder and ball, and a
musquet, and then left them to shift as well
as they could. Here they staid three weeks,
when two men came in a canoe, that had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg&nbsp;34]</a></span>
been left in another Maroon Island near
<i>Benecca</i>, and carried them thither. A fortnight
after they espied a Sloop at sea, which
had lately escaped from the <i>Spaniards</i> at the
Bay of <i>Honduras</i>, which, upon a signal stood
in and took them all off.</p>

<p>At an Island to the westward, the Pirates
cleaned their ship, and then sailed towards
<i>St. Christophers</i> to meet Captain <i>Moor</i>.</p>

<p><i>Spriggs</i> next stood towards <i>Bermudas</i>,
where he took a Schooner belonging to
<i>Boston</i>, from which he took all the Men,
and sunk the Vessel.</p>

<p>Instead of going to <i>Newfoundland</i>, they
came back to the Islands, and on the 8th
of <i>June</i>, to windward of <i>St. Christophers</i>,
they took a Sloop, <i>Nicholas Trot</i>, Master,
belonging to <i>St. Eustatia</i>, whose men they
hoisted as high as the main fore-tops, and
so let them fall down again; then whipping
them about the deck, they gave <i>Trot</i> his
Sloop, and let him go, keeping only two of
his men, besides the plunder. Two or three
days after, they took a ship coming from
<i>Rhode Island</i> to <i>St. Christophers</i>, laden with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span>
provisions and some horses, and burnt ship,
men, and horses: Since when <i>Spriggs</i> has
not been heard of: though it is supposed he
went to <i>Madagascar</i>, to spend, in rioting
and wantonness, his ill gotten plunder; till
by a letter from <i>Jamaica</i>, of the 2nd of
<i>March</i> last, we understood, That he had
been again at the Bay of <i>Honduras</i>, and
taken sixteen Sail.</p>

<h2>CAPTAIN EDWARD LOWE,
AND HIS CREW</h2>


<p><i>Edward Lowe</i>, born at <i>Westminster</i>, very
early began the Trade of Plundering; for
if any Child refused him what he had,
he must fight him. When he grew bigger,
he took to Gaming among Blackshoe Boys
upon the <i>Parade</i>, with whom he used to
play the <em>Whole Game</em>, as they call it; that
is, cheat every Body, and if they refused,
they had to fight him.</p>

<p><i>Ned</i> went to Sea with his eldest Brother,
and leaving him in <i>New-England</i>, he worked
in a Rigging House, at Boston, for some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg&nbsp;40]</a></span>
Time, when not liking that, he returned to
<i>England</i> to see his Mother, with whom he
did not stay long before he took his Leave
of her, for the last Time, as he said, and
returned to <i>Boston</i>, where he shipped himself
in a Sloop that was bound to the Bay
of <i>Honduras</i>; and when he arrived there,
he was made Patron of the Boat, to bring
the logwood on board to lade the ship;
where he differing with the Captain about
the hurry of taking the logwood on board,
<i>Lowe</i> takes up a loaden Musquet, and fired at
him; then putting off the Boat, he, with
twelve of his companions, goes to sea.
Next day they met a small vessel, which
they took, made a Black Flag, and declared
War against all the world. From hence
they proceed to the Island of the <i>Grand
Caimanes</i>, where they met with <i>George
Lowther</i>, who took him under his protection
as an ally, without any formal Treaty;
which <i>Lowe</i> readily agreed to. But parting
with <i>Lowther</i> on the 28th of <i>May</i>, as we have
already given in an Account in <i>Lowther&rsquo;s</i>
Life, <i>Lowe</i> took a Vessel belonging to <i>Amboy</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>
which he plundered, and then stood away
to the South East, by which he avoided two
Sloops which the Governor had sent to take
him from <i>Rhode</i> Island.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/pirates21.png" width="250" height="217"
alt="Sketch of a person wearing an ornate headdress" />
</div>

<p><i>July</i> the 12th, he sailed into the Harbour
of Port <i>Rosemary</i>, where he found 13 small
vessels at anchor, whom he told they
would have no quarters if they resisted;
which so frightened the Masters of the
vessels, that they all yielded. Out of them
he took whatever he wanted, keeping for
his own Use a Schooner of 80 Tons, on
board of which he put 10 Carriage Guns,
and 50 men, and named her the <i>Fancy</i>
making himself Captain, and appointing
<i>Charles Harris</i> Captain of the Brigantine.
Making up a complement of 80 men
out of the vessels, some by force, and
others by their own inclinations, he sailed
away from <i>Mablehead</i>, and
soon after he met two Sloops
bound for <i>Boston</i>, with provisions
for the garrison; but
there being an officer and
soldiers on board, he thought
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span>
it the safest way, after some small resistance,
to let them go on about their business.</p>

<p>They then steered for the <i>Leeward</i>
Islands; but in their voyage met with
such a hurricane, as had not been known
in the memory of man. After the storm
was over, they got safe to one of the small
Islands of the <i>Carribees</i>, and there refitted
their vessels as well as they could. As
soon as the Brigantine was ready, they
took a short cruise, leaving the Schooner
in the harbour till their return; which
had not been many days at sea, before
she met a ship that had lost all her
masts, on board of which they went, and
took, in money and goods, to the value of
1000<i>l.</i> Upon this success, the Brigantine
returned to the Schooner, which being then
ready to sail, they agreed to go to the
<i>Azores</i>, or Western Islands, where <i>Lowe</i>
took a <i>French</i> Ship of 32 Guns, and in <i>St.
Michael&rsquo;s</i> Road, he took several sail that
were lying there, without firing a gun.
Being in great want of water, he sent to
the Governor of <i>St. Michael&rsquo;s</i> for a Supply,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span>
promising upon that Condition, to release
the Ships he had taken, otherwise to burn
them all; which the Governor, for the sake
of the Ships, agreed to. Thereupon he
released six, keeping only the <i>Rose</i> Pink, of
which he took the Command.</p>

<p>The Pirates took several of the Guns out
of the ships, and mounted them on board
the <i>Rose</i>. <i>Lowe</i> ordered the Schooner to lie
in the Fare between <i>St. Michael&rsquo;s</i> and <i>St.
Mary&rsquo;s</i>, where he met with Captain <i>Carter</i>
in the <i>Wright</i> Galley; who, defending himself,
they cut and mangled him and his Men
in a barbarous manner; after which, they
were for burning the ship, but contented
themselves with cutting her cable, rigging,
and sails to pieces, and so left her to the
mercy of the seas. From hence they sailed
to the Island of <i>Maderas</i>, where they took
a fishing boat, with two old men and a
boy in her, one of whom they sent ashore,
demanding a boat of water, otherwise they
would kill the old man, which being complied
with, the old man was discharged.
From hence they sailed to the <i>Canaries</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg&nbsp;44]</a></span>
and thence continued their course for the
<i>Cape de Verde</i> Islands, where they took
a ship called the <i>Liverpool Merchant</i>, from
which they took 300 gallons of brandy,
two guns and carriages, besides six of the
men, and then obliged them to go to the
Isle of <i>May</i>. They also took two <i>Portugueze</i>
ships bound to <i>Brazil</i>, and three Sloops
from <i>St. Thomas&rsquo;s</i> bound to <i>Curaso</i>: All of
which they plundered, and let them go,
except one Sloop, by which they heard that
two Gallies were expected at the Western
Islands. Her they manned, and sent in
Quest of these Ships whilst they careened
the <i>Rose</i> at <i>Cape de Verde</i>; but the Sloop
missing the prey, was reduced to great
want of water and provisions, so that they
ventured to go ashore <i>St. Michael&rsquo;s</i>, and pass
for Traders; where, being suspected by the
Governor, they were conducted into the
Castle, and provided for as long as they
lived.</p>

<p><i>Lowe&rsquo;s</i> ship was overset a-careening, so
that he was reduced to his old Schooner,
aboard of which there went about an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span>
hundred as bold rogues as ever was hanged,
and sailed to the <i>West-Indies</i>, where they
took a rich <i>Portugueze</i> ship bound Home
from <i>Bahia</i>, putting to the torture several
of the men, who confest the Captain flung
into the sea a bag of 11000 Moidores. This
made <i>Lowe</i> swear a thousand oaths; and
after cutting off his lips, he murdered him
and all his Crew, being 36 men.</p>

<p>After this, they cruised to the Northward,
and took several Vessels and then
steered for the Bay of <i>Honduras</i>, where they
took Five <i>English</i> Sloops, and a Pink, and
a <i>Spaniard</i> of 6 Guns and 70 men, whom
they killed every man; which being done
they rummaged the <i>Spanish</i> Ship, bringing
all the booty on board their own
vessel.</p>

<p>In the next cruise, between the <i>Leeward
Islands</i> and the Main, they took two Snows
from Jamaica to Liverpool, and just after
a Ship called the <i>Amsterdam Merchant</i>, the
Captain thereof he slit his Nose, cut his
Ears off, and then plundered the ship and
let her go. Afterwards he took a Sloop
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span>
bound to <i>Amboy</i>, of whose Men he tied lighted
matches between the fingers, which burnt
the flesh off the bones, and afterwards set
them ashore in an uninhabited part of the
country, as also other ships which fell a
prey to those villains.</p>

<p>One of His Majesty&rsquo;s Men-of-War called
the <i>Greyhound</i>, of 20 guns and 120 men, hearing
of their barbarous actions, went in search
of them and, seeing the Pirates, allowed <i>Lowe</i>
to chase them at first, till they were in readiness
to engage him, and when he was within
gunshot, tacked about and stood towards
him. The Pirates edged away under the
Man-of-War&rsquo;s stern, making a running fight
for about two hours. But little wind happening,
the Pirates gained from her; thereupon
the <i>Greyhound</i> left off firing, and turned
all her hands to her oars, and came up
with them, when the fight was renewed
with a brisk fire on both sides, till the
<i>Ranger&rsquo;s</i> main-yard was shot down; upon
which, the <i>Greyhound</i> pressing close, <i>Lowe</i>
bore away and left his consort, who seeing
the cowardice of his Commadore, and that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg&nbsp;47]</a></span>
there was no possibility of escaping, called
out for quarters.</p>

<p><i>Lowe&rsquo;s</i> conduct in this engagement shewed
him to be a cowardly villain; for had
he fought half as briskly as <i>Harris</i>, the
Man-of-War could never have taken either
of them. The <i>Greyhound</i> carried her
Prize to <i>Rhode-Island</i>, which was looked
upon to be of such signal Service to the
Colony, that in Council they resolved to
compliment <i>Peter Sulgard</i> Captain, with
the Freedom of their Corporation. They
secured the prisoners under a strong guard
in Jail, till a Court of Vice-Admiralty
could be held for their Trials, which was
on the 10th of <i>July</i> at <i>Newport</i>, lasting
three Days. The Judges were <i>William
Dummer</i>, Esq; Lieutenant Governor of the
<i>Massachusets</i>, President; <i>Nathaniel Payne</i>,
Esq; <i>John Lechmore</i>, Esq; Surveyor
General; <i>John Valentine</i>, Esq; Advocate
General; <i>Samuel Cranston</i>, Governor of
<i>Rhode Island</i>; <i>John Menzies</i>, Esq; Judge
of the Admiralty; <i>Richard Ward</i>, Esq;
Registrar; and Mr. <i>Jahleet Brinton</i>, Provost
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span>
Marshal. <i>Robert Auchmuta</i>, Esq, was appointed
by the Court, Counsel for the
prisoners here under mentioned.</p>

<p><i>Charles Harris</i>, Captain, <i>William Blads</i>,
<i>Daniel Hyde</i>, <i>Thomas Powel</i>, jun., <i>Stephen
Munden</i>, <i>Thomas Hugget</i>, <i>William Read</i>, <i>Peter
Kneeves</i>, <i>James Brinkley</i>, <i>Joseph Sound</i>, <i>William
Shutfield</i>, <i>Edward Eaton</i>, <i>John Brown</i>,
<i>Edward Lawson</i>, <i>Owen Rice</i>, <i>John Tomkins</i>,
<i>John Fitzgerald</i>, <i>Abraham Lacy</i>, <i>Thomas Linester</i>,
<i>Francis Leyton</i>, <i>John Walters</i>, Quarter-master,
<i>William Jones</i>, <i>Charles Church</i>, <i>Thomas
Hazel</i>, and <i>John Bright</i>, who were all executed
the 19th of <i>July</i>, 1723, near <i>Newport</i> in <i>Rhode
Island</i>; but <i>John Brown</i> and <i>Patrick Cunningham</i>
were recommended to Mercy.</p>

<p>The eight following were found Not
Guilty; <i>John Wilson</i>, <i>Henry Barnes</i>, <i>Thomas
Jones</i>, <i>Joseph Switzer</i>, <i>Thomas Mumper</i>, Indian,
<i>John Hencher</i>, Doctor, <i>John Fletcher</i>, and
<i>Thomas Child</i>.</p>

<p>Instead of working repentance in <i>Lowe</i>,
this deliverance made him ten times worse,
vowing revenge upon all they should meet
with for the future, which they executed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg&nbsp;49]</a></span>
upon <i>Nathan Skiff</i>, Master of a <i>Whale-fishing</i>
Sloop, whom they whipt naked about the
deck, and then cut off his ears, making his
torture their sport. At length being weary
thereof, they shot him through the head,
and sunk his vessel. Some days after, he
took a fishing boat off of <i>Black</i> Island, and
only cut off the master&rsquo;s head; but next
day taking two Whale Boats near <i>Rhode</i>
Island, he brutally killed one of the masters
and cut off the ears of the other. From
hence he went to <i>Newfoundland</i>, where he
took 23 <i>French</i> Vessels, and mann&rsquo;d one of
them of 22 Guns with pirates; after which,
they took and plundered 18 ships, some of
which they destroyed.</p>

<p>The latter end of <i>July</i>, <i>Lowe</i> took a large
ship called the <i>Merry Christmas</i>, and mounted
her with 34 Guns, on which he goes aboard,
taking the title of Admiral, and sails to the
Western Islands, where he took a Brigantine
manned with <i>English</i> and <i>Portugueze</i>, the
Latter of whom he hanged.</p>

<p>Afterwards <i>Lowe</i> went to the Coast of
<i>Guinea</i>, but nothing happened till he came
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg&nbsp;50]</a></span>
to <i>Sierra Leon</i>, in <i>Africa</i>, when he met with
the <i>Delight</i>, which he took, mounting her
with 16 Guns, and 60 men, appointing <i>Spriggs</i>
Captain, and from whom two days after he
separated.</p>

<p>In <i>January</i> after, he took a Ship called
<i>Squirrel</i>, but what came of him afterwards
we cannot tell.</p>

<h2>CAPTAIN GEORGE LOWTHER,
AND HIS CREW</h2>


<p><i>George Lowther</i> went second Mate on board
the <i>Gambia Castle</i>, belonging to the <i>Royal
African</i> Company, on board which was
Captain <i>Massey</i>, with soldiers that he was
to command under Colonel <i>Whitney</i>, whom
were landed on <i>James</i> Island; but the Fort
and Garrison not agreeing the Company
soon after lost a Galley worth 10000<i>l.</i> by it.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/pirates24.png" width="250" height="216"
alt="Sketch map of James Island, South Carolina" />
</div>

<p><i>Massey</i> finding he must be over-ruled by
the merchants, soon began to complain of
their ill-treatment of his men
in their allowance, saying he
did not come to be a <i>Guinea</i>
Slave; and that if they did not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg&nbsp;54]</a></span>
use him and his men better, he should take
other measures.</p>

<p>At the same time, there happened a
dispute between the Captain of the ship
and <i>Lowther</i>, which very much contributing
to Lowther&rsquo;s design: For <i>Lowther</i> finding
himself neglected by the Captain, found
means to ingratiate himself into the favour
of the sailors, who, upon the Captain&rsquo;s
going to punish him, swore, They would
knock down the first man that should offer
to lay hands on him; which <i>Lowther</i> improved
to a general disaffection of the ship&rsquo;s
Crew. <i>Massey</i> in the meantime, having
contracted an intimacy with <i>Lowther</i>, they
agreed to curb their enemies, and provide
for themselves some other way; which the
Captain perceiving, he goes on shore to
the Governor and Factor, to consult what
methods to take. But <i>Lowther</i> apprehending
it was against him, he sent a letter in the
same boat to <i>Massey</i>, advising him to repair
on board, to put their project in execution.</p>

<p>Upon which <i>Massey</i> harangued the
Soldiers, saying, <em>You that have a Mind to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg&nbsp;55]</a></span>
return to England</em>, may now do it; which
they all agreed to. Then he went to the
Governor&rsquo;s appartment, and took his bed,
baggage, plate and furniture, believing the
Governor would go with him, which he
refused; however <i>Massey</i> came aboard with
the Governor&rsquo;s son. After demolishing all
the guns of the Fort, they weighed anchor,
and fell down, but soon ran the ship aground;
upon which <i>Massey</i> returns to the Fort, remounts
the guns, and keeps garrison till
the ship got clear. In the meantime
Captain <i>Russell</i> got off but was not suffered
to come on board, although he offered
<i>Lowther</i> what terms he pleased. Next
tide they got the ship afloat, having first
nailed up and dismounted all the cannon.
Then putting the Governor&rsquo;s son ashore,
they put out to sea, when <i>Lowther</i> called
upon the men, and told them, <em>It was Madness
to think of returning to <span class="roman">England</span>; for what
they had done, would be judged a Capital Offence</em>;
and therefore, since they had a good ship
under them, he proposed that they should
seek their fortunes upon the Seas, as others
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>
had done before them, which they all agreed
to, calling the ship <i>The Delivery</i>, and swore
to stand by one another.</p>

<p><i>Lowther</i> left the Fort the 13th of <i>June</i>,
and on the 20th, near <i>Barbadoes</i>, he came up
with a Brigantine, belonging to <i>Boston</i>, which
he plundered, and then let go. After this
he proceeded to <i>Hispaniola</i>, where he met
with a <i>French</i> Sloop loaden with wine and
brandy, on board whom Captain <i>Massey</i>
went, pretending at first to be a merchant;
but finding her to be a Ship of value, he
told Monsieur, He must have it all without
money. On board her, there was 30 casks
of brandy, 5 hogsheads of wine, several
pieces of chintz, and 70<i>l.</i> in money, all of
which they took, only <i>Lowther</i> return&rsquo;d the
French Master five pounds again.</p>

<p>But this good harmony did not last long
amongst them, <i>Massey</i> was uneasy, and resolved
to leave them; which <i>Lowther</i> agreed
to, giving him a Sloop he had just before
taken, to go where he thought fit. Accordingly
<i>Massey</i> goes aboard, with ten men,
and comes in directly for <i>Jamaica</i>, where,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg&nbsp;57]</a></span>
putting a bold face on the matter, he informs
Sir <i>Nicholas Laws</i>, the then Governor,
how he had left <i>Lowther</i> the pirate, and of all
that had been transacted before, adding,
That he assisted him at the River <i>Gambia</i>
only to save so many of His Majesty&rsquo;s
subjects, and return to <i>England</i>.</p>

<p><i>Massey</i> was well received, and, at his
own report, he was sent on board the
<i>Happy Sloop</i>, to cruise off <i>Hispaniola</i> for
<i>Lowther</i>; but not meeting with him, he
returned to <i>Jamaica</i>, and getting a Certificate,
he came home to <i>England</i>, where, when
he arrived, he writes to the <i>African</i> Company,
relating the whole transaction of his voyage,
but excuses it as an inadvertency, by
his being ill-used; for which, if they would
not forgive him, he begged to die like a
soldier, and not be hanged like a dog.
This not producing so favourable an answer
as he expected, he went the next day to
the Lord Chief Justice Chambers, and
enquired, If there had been ever a Warrant
granted and against one Captain <i>Massey</i> for
Piracy. But being told, There was not, he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span>
said, He was the Man, and that the <i>African</i>
Company would soon apply to my Lord for
one, which if they did, he lodged in <i>Aldersgate
street</i>, where the Officer might at any
time find him. This the Clerk took down
in writing, and a Warrant being soon
granted, the Tipstaff went accordingly, and
took him without any trouble.</p>

<p>But still there was no person to charge
him, neither could they prove the letter to
be his own hand-writing, till the Justice
interrogated him, <em>Whether he did write the
letter or not</em>; which he readily confessed,
as also gave an ample account of the whole
voyage, thereupon he was committed to
<i>Newgate</i>, though soon after he was admitted
out upon bail.</p>

<p><i>July</i> the 5th, 1723, he was tried at the
<i>Old-Baily</i> by a Court of Admiralty, when
Captain <i>Russell</i> and others appeared against
him: But he would have saved them all
that trouble, for he confessed more than
they knew, fixing the facts so firm upon
himself, that he was found Guilty, received
Sentence of Death, and was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span>
executed three weeks after at <i>Execution
Dock</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>But to return to <i>Lowther</i>, whom <i>Massey</i>
left cruising off of <i>Hispaniola</i>, who plying to
the Windward near <i>Porto Rico</i>, took two
sail, one was a small <i>Bristol</i> Ship, the other
a <i>Spanish</i> Pirate, who had taken the <i>Bristol</i>
Ship; which so provoked <i>Lowther</i>, that he
threatened to
put all the <i>Spaniards</i>
to Death,
for daring to
intermeddle in
his Affairs: But
at last he contented
himself
with burning
both their ships; and the <i>Spaniards</i> getting
away in their launch, they thought they
were well off.</p>

<p>Afterwards he took a small Sloop from
<i>St. Christophers</i>, which he manned; and
carried with him to an island where they
cleaned, and then going aboard, they sailed
towards the Bay of <i>Honduras</i>, where they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg&nbsp;60]</a></span>
met with a small vessel with 13 Hands, of
the same employment, under Captain <i>Lowe</i>,
whom <i>Lowther</i> received as friends, inviting
them, as they were few in number, to join
their strength together; which being accepted
of, <i>Lowther</i> continued Captain, and
<i>Lowe</i> was made Lieutenant, burning his own
ship. Then coming into the Bay, they fell
upon a ship of two hundred tons, called
the <i>Greyhound</i>; against whom <i>Lowther</i> firing
his guns, hoisted the piratical Colours,
which Captain <i>Edward</i> bravely returned;
but at length finding the Pirate too strong
for him he yielded, and the Pirate came on
Board, and not only rifling the ship, but
beat and cut the men in a cruel manner.
In crusing about the Bay, they took several
other vessels without any resistance, particularly
a Sloop of 100 Tons, which they
mounted with 8 carriages and 10 swivel
guns. With this fleet, <i>Lowther</i> in the
<i>Happy Delivery</i>, <i>Lowe</i> in the <i>Rhode Island</i>
Sloop, <i>Harris</i> in <i>Hamilton&rsquo;s</i> Sloop, left the
Bay, and came to <i>Port Mayo</i>, where they
made preparations to careen, carrying
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg&nbsp;61]</a></span>
ashore all their sails, to lay their plunder
and stores in; but when they were busy
at work, a body of the natives came down
and attacked the Pirates unprepared, who
were glad to fly to their Sloops, and leave
them masters of the field, leaving the <i>Happy
Delivery</i> behind them, contenting themselves
with the <i>Ranger</i>, which had only 20
guns, and 8 swivels, taking all the men on
board her, wherein they presently began
to quarrel, laying the blame upon one
another. Being very much in want of
provisions, they got to the <i>West Indies</i>,
<i>May</i> 1722, and near the Island of <i>Descada</i>
took a Brigantine stored with provisions
and necessaries, which put them in better
temper. Then they watered and stood to
the Northward, intending to visit the North
Coast of <i>America</i>, and in Latitude 38, they
took the <i>Rebecca</i> of <i>Boston</i>, at which Time
the Crews divided, <i>Lowe</i> with 44 Hands
went on board the Brigantine, and <i>Lowther</i>
with the same number, staid in the Sloop,
separating that very night, being the 28th
of May 1722.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg&nbsp;62]</a></span>
<i>Lowther</i> cruised a pretty while among
the Islands to no purpose, till at length he
fell in with a <i>Martinico</i> Man, which proved
a seasonable relief, he being reduced to
great want of provisions, and after that a
<i>Guinea</i> Man. After which they thought it
time to clean, in order to prepare for new
adventures; for which purpose they sailed
to the Island of <i>Blanco</i>, which is a low
Island 30 leagues from the main of <i>Spanish
America</i>, where he unrigged his Sloop,
sending his guns, rigging, and sails
ashore, and putting his vessel upon the
careen. But the <i>Eagle</i> Sloop of <i>Barbadoes</i>,
coming near this Island, and seeing her,
supposing her to be a Pirate, took the
advantage of attacking her when unprepared,
who immediately hoisted the <i>St.
George&rsquo;s</i> Flag at her top-mast head to bid
them defiance: But when they found the
<i>Eagle</i> resolved to board them in good
earnest, the Pirates cut their cable, and
hawled the stern on shore, which obliged
the <i>Eagle</i> to come to an anchor athwart the
hawse, where they engaged them till they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg&nbsp;63]</a></span>
cried out for Quarters. At which time <i>Lowther</i>
and 12 men made their escape, but they
took the rest, and brought them to <i>Camena</i>,
where the <i>Spanish</i> Governor condemned
the Sloop to the captors, and sent 23 Hands
to scour the Bushes of <i>Blanco</i> for the Pirates,
when they took 40; but could not find <i>Lowther</i>,
three men and a little Boy. <i>John
Churchill</i>, <i>Edward Mackonald</i>, <i>Nicholas Lewis</i>,
<i>Rich. West</i>, <i>Sam Lavercot</i>, <i>Rob. White</i>, <i>John
Shaw</i>, <i>And. Hunter</i>, <i>Jonathan Delve</i>, <i>Matthew
Freeborn</i>, and <i>Henry Watson</i>, were hanged,
<i>Roger Granger</i>, <i>Ralph Candem</i>, and <i>Robert
Willis</i>, were acquitted. And Captain <i>Lowther</i>,
it is said, afterwards shot himself, being
found dead, and a pistol burst by his side.</p>

<h2>CAPTAIN ANSTIS, AND HIS
CREW</h2>


<p><i>Thomas Anstis</i> shipped himself at <i>Providence</i>,
in the Year 1718, aboard the <i>Buck</i> Sloop,
and was one of the six that conspired
together to get off with the vessel, along
with <i>Howel Davis</i>, <i>Dennis Topping</i>, and <i>Walter
Kennedy</i>, etc. I shall only observe, that this
combination was the beginning of Captain
<i>Roberts&rsquo;s</i> company, which afterwards proved
so formidable, from whom <i>Anstis</i> separated
the 18th of <i>April</i>, 1721, leaving his Commodore
to pursue his adventures upon the
Coasts of <i>Guinea</i>, whilst he returned to the
<i>West Indies</i>, upon the same design.</p>

<p>About the middle of <i>June</i>, he met with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg&nbsp;68]</a></span>
one Captain <i>Maiston</i>, between <i>Hispaniola</i>
and <i>Jamaica</i>, bound to <i>New-York</i>, from which
he took all the wearing apparel, liquors and
provisions, and six men. Afterwards he
met with the <i>Irwin</i>, Captain <i>Ross</i> from <i>Cork</i>,
on the Coast of <i>Martinico</i>, which ship had
Colonel <i>Doyly</i> of <i>Montserrat</i> on board, and
his Family, and 600 barrels of beef.</p>

<p>Afterwards they went into one of the
Islands to clean, and thence proceeding
towards <i>Bermudas</i>, they met with a stout
ship called the <i>Morning Star</i>, bound from
<i>Guinea</i> to <i>Carolina</i>, which they kept for
their own use. Just after, they took a
ship from <i>Barbadoes</i> bound to <i>New England</i>,
from whence taking her guns, they mounted
the <i>Morning Star</i> with 32 pieces of cannon,
and 100 men, appointing <i>John Fenn</i> Captain:
For <i>Anstis</i> was so in love with his own
vessel, she being a good sailor, he made it
his choice to stay in her, and let <i>Fenn</i> have
the other ship. Though they were not
sufficiently strong, yet being most new men,
they could not agree, but resolving to break
up company, sent a Petition to His Majesty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg&nbsp;69]</a></span>
by a Merchant Ship, expecting her Return
at <i>Cuba</i>.</p>

<p>Here they staid about nine months; but
not having provisions for above two, they
were obliged to take what the Island afforded;
which is many sorts of fish, particularly
turtle; though they eat not a bit of bread,
nor flesh meat, during their being on the
Island.</p>

<p>They passed their time here in dancing,
and other diversions, agreeable to these
sort of folks. Among the rest, they appointed
a mock Court of Judicature, to try
one another for Piracy, and he that was a
Criminal one day, was made a Judge
another. I shall never forget one of their
Trials, which for the curiosity of it, I shall
relate. The Judge got up into a tree, having
a dirty tarpaulin over his shoulders for a
robe, and a Thrum Cap upon his head,
with a large pair of spectacles upon his
nose, and a monkey bearing up his train,
with abundance of Officers attending him,
with crows and hand-spikes instead of
wands and tip-staves in their hands.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg&nbsp;70]</a></span>
Before whom the Criminals were brought
out, making 1000 wry Faces; when the
Attorney-General moved the Court, and
said, An&rsquo;t please your Lordship, and you
Gentlemen of the Jury, this fellow before
you is a sad dog, a sad, a sad dog, and I
hope your Lordship will order him to be
hanged out of the way; he has committed
Piracy upon the High Seas; nay, my Lord,
that&rsquo;s not all; this fellow, this sad dog before
you, has out-rid a hundred storms, and you
know, my Lord, <em>He that&rsquo;s born to be hanged,
will never be drowned</em>. Nor is this all, he
has been guilty of worse villany than this,
and that is of drinking of small beer; and
your Lordship knows, there was never a
sober fellow but what was
a rogue&mdash;My Lord, I should
have said more, but your
Lordship knows our rum is
out, and how should a Man
speak that has drunk a dram
to-day.</p>

dog. What have you to say why you
may not be tucked up, and set a-sun-drying
like a scare-crow?&mdash;Are you
Guilty, or not?</p>

<p><i>Prisoner.</i> Not Guilty, an&rsquo;t please your

<p><i>Judge.</i> Not Guilty! say so again, and I
will have you hanged without any
Trial.</p>

<p><i>Prisoner.</i> An&rsquo;t please your Worship&rsquo;s
Honour, my Lord, I am as honest a
fellow as ever went between stem
and stern of a ship, and can hand,
reef, steer, and clap two ends of
a rope together, as well as e&rsquo;er a He

was taken by one <i>George Bradley</i> (the
name of the Judge) a notorious
Pirate, and a sad rogue as ever was

<p><i>Judge.</i> Answer me, Sirrah&mdash;how will you

Gentlemen of the Jury, we have
nothing to do but to proceed to
Judgment.</p>

<p><i>Attorney-Gen.</i> Right, my Lord; for if
the fellow should be suffered to
speak, he might clear himself; and
that, you know, is an affront to the
Court.</p>

<p><i>Prisoner.</i> Pray, my Lord, I hope your
Lordship will consider.</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> Consider!&mdash;How dare you talk
of considering!&mdash;Sirrah, Sirrah, I
have never considered in all my

<p><i>Judge.</i> What have we to do with Reason?&mdash;I
would have you to know, Sirrah,
we do not sit here to hear Reason&mdash;we
go according to Law.&mdash;Is our
dinner ready?</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General.</i> Yes, my Lord.</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> Then harkee you rascal at the
Bar, hear me, Sirrah, hear me.&mdash;You
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg&nbsp;73]</a></span>
must be hanged for three reasons:
<em>First</em>, because it is not fit that I should
sit as Judge, and no-body to be
hang&rsquo;d: <em>Secondly</em>, You must be hang&rsquo;d
because you have a damn&rsquo;d hanging
Look: <em>Thirdly</em>, You must be hanged,
because I am hungry. There&rsquo;s Law
for you, ye dog; take him away,
Gaoler.</p>

<img src="images/pirates29.png" width="223" height="250"
alt="Silhouette of a person wearing a broad-brimmed hat" />
</div>

<p>By this we may see how these fellows
can jest upon things, the thoughts of which
should make them tremble.</p>

<p><i>August</i> 1722, they made ready the Brigantine,
and came out to sea, where meeting
their correspondent returning, and finding
nothing done, they all agreed to ply their
old trade. So they sailed with the ship
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg&nbsp;74]</a></span>
and Brigantine to the Southward, where they
ran the <i>Morning Star</i> upon the <i>Grand Carmanes</i>,
and wrecked her; the next Day
<i>Anstis</i> went ashore to fetch the men off,
who were all safe. <i>Anstis</i> had just time
to get Captain <i>Fenn</i>, and a few others on
board, before the <i>Hector</i> and <i>Adventure</i>
came down upon him; but he got to sea,
and one of the Men-of-War after him,
keeping within gun-shot several hours,
when the wind dying away, the Pirates
got to their oars, and rowed for their
lives.</p>

<p>The <i>Hector</i> landed her men, and took
40 of the <i>Morning Star&rsquo;s</i> Crew, without any
resistance, they pretending they were glad
of this opportunity; the rest hid themselves
in the woods.</p>

<p>The Brigantine after her escape, sailed
to an Island, near the Bay of <i>Honduras</i>, to
clean, and in her way took a Sloop, Captain
<i>Durfey</i> Commander, which they destroyed,
but brought the men on board. While she
was cleaning, <i>Durfey</i> conspired with some
of the prisoners, to carry off the Brigantine;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg&nbsp;75]</a></span>
but it being discovered, he and four or five
more got ashore, with arms and ammunition;
and when the Pirates&rsquo; Canoe came in
for Water, seized the boat and men; upon
which, <i>Anstis</i> sent another boat with 30
hand ashore; but <i>Durfey</i> gave them such a
warm reception that they were glad to
return back again.</p>

<p>In <i>December</i> 1722, <i>Anstis</i> left this place,
taking in his cruise a good ship. He
mounted her with 24 Guns and made <i>Fenn</i>
Commander. From hence they went to the
<i>Bahama</i> Islands, taking what they wanted.</p>

<p>As they were cleaning their ship the
<i>Winchelsea</i> came down upon them, when
most of them escaped to the woods; but
<i>Anstis</i> having a light pair of heels, escaped
in the Brigantine. Afterwards, some of the
Company, being tired of this trade, shot
<i>Anstis</i> in his Hammock, and put the rest
in irons, and then carried the Brigantine to
<i>Curacco</i>, a <i>Dutch</i> Settlement, where they
were hanged, and those that delivered up the
vessel acquitted. <i>Fenn</i> was soon after taken
by the Man-of-War&rsquo;s Men, straggling in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg&nbsp;76]</a></span>
woods, with a few more, and carried to
<i>Antegoa</i> and hanged. But some escaped
among the negroes, and were never heard
of since.</p>

<h2>CAPTAIN JOHN PHILLIPS,
AND HIS CREW</h2>


<p><i>John Phillips</i> was bred a carpenter, but
sailing in a West Country ship to <i>Newfoundland</i>,
was taken by <i>Anstis</i>, who soon
persuaded him to join with him, making
him Carpenter of the Vessel, in which
station he continued till they broke up at
<i>Tobago</i>, when he came Home in a Sloop that
was sunk in <i>Bristol</i> Channel. But he did not
stay long in <i>England</i>; for hearing of some
of his companions being taken in <i>Bristol</i>
Gaol, he moved off to <i>Topsham</i>, and there
shipped himself with one Captain <i>Wadham</i>
for <i>Newfoundland</i>, where when the ship came
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg&nbsp;80]</a></span>
he ran away, and hired himself a splitter in
the Fishery for the season: but he soon
combined with others in the Fishery, to go
off with one of the vessels that lay in the
Harbour, and turn Pirate, and accordingly
fixed upon the 29th of <i>August</i>, 1713, at Night;
but of 16 Men that promised five only were
as good as their Word. Notwithstanding,
<i>Phillips</i> was for pushing on, assuring them
that they should soon increase their company.
Hereupon they seized a vessel, and
went out to sea, when they soon began
to settle their Officers to prevent dispute,
appointing, <i>John Phillips</i>, Captain; <i>John Nutt</i>,
Navigator of the Vessel; <i>James Sparks</i>, Gunner;
<i>Thomas Fern</i>, Carpenter; and <i>William
White</i> was only a private man among them.</p>

<p>Before they left the Banks, they took
several small fishing vessels, out of which
they took some more Hands, and then sailed
to the <i>West-Indies</i>: Among those that were
taken, was one <i>John Rose Archer</i> who having
been a pirate under <i>Blackbeard</i> was made
Quarter-Master to the company: They
came off <i>Barbadoes</i> in <i>October</i>, and cruised
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg&nbsp;81]</a></span>
about the Islands about three Months, without
meeting with a vessel, so that they were
almost starved for want of provisions, when
at length they fell in with a <i>Martinico</i> Man
of 12 guns and 35 hands, upon which they
hoisted the Black Flag and ran up along side
of the Sloop, with piratical Colours flying,
swearing, If they did not strike immediately,
they must expect no quarters; which
so frightened the <i>Frenchman</i>, that he never
fired a gun. Having got this supply, they
took her provisions, and four of her men.</p>

<p>Having occasion to clean their vessel,
<i>Phillips</i> proposed <i>Tobago</i>; and just as they
had done, a Man-of-War&rsquo;s boat came into
the Harbour, the ship cruising to the Leeward
of the Island; which was no sooner
gone, but they warped out, and plied to the
Windward for safety.</p>

<p>In a few days they took a Snow with a
few Hands in it, on board of which they
sent <i>Fern</i> the Carpenter, <i>William Smith</i>,
<i>Philips Wood</i>, and <i>Taylor</i>; but <i>Fern</i> being
dissatisfied at <i>Archer&rsquo;s</i> being preferred before
him to be Quarter-Master, persuaded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg&nbsp;82]</a></span>
the rest to go off with the prize; but <i>Phillips</i>
gave them Chase, and coming up with them,
shot <i>Wood</i>, and wounded <i>Taylor</i> in the leg;
upon which the other two surrendered.</p>

<p>From <i>Tobago</i> they stood away to the
Northward, and took a <i>Portugueze</i> bound
for <i>Brazil</i>, and two or three Sloops for
<i>Jamaica</i>, in one of which <i>Fern</i> endeavouring
to go off, was killed by <i>Phillips</i>, as was also
another man for the like attempt, which
made all the others more fearful of discovering
their Minds, dreading the villany
of a few hardened wretches, who feared
neither God nor Devil, as <i>Phillips</i> was often
used blasphemously to say.</p>

<p>On the 25th of March, they took two ships
from <i>Virginia</i>, the Master&rsquo;s name of one
was <i>John Phillips</i>, the Pirate&rsquo;s Name-sake;
of the other, <i>Robert Mortimer</i>, a stout young
man. <i>Phillips</i> staid on board <i>Mortimer&rsquo;s</i>
Ship, while they transported the crew to
the Sloop, when <i>Mortimer</i> took up a hand-spike
and struck <i>Phillips</i> over the Head;
but not knocking him down, he recovered
and wounded <i>Mortimer</i> with his sword;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg&nbsp;83]</a></span>
and the other two Pirates who were on
board, coming to <i>Phillip&rsquo;s</i> assistance they
cut <i>Mortimer</i> to pieces, while his own two
men stood and looked on. Out of the other
<i>Virginia</i> Man, they took <i>Edward Cheesman</i>,
a carpenter, to supply the Place of <i>Fern</i>,
who being averse to that way of life, proposed
to <i>J. Philamore</i>, who was ordered to
row <i>Cheesman</i> on board <i>Mortimer&rsquo;s</i> ship,
to overthrow their Piratical government;
which from time to time, as occasion
offered, they consulted how to do. The
Pirates, in the mean time, robbed and
plundered several ships and vessels, bending
their course towards <i>Newfoundland</i>,
where they designed to raise more men,
and do all the mischief they could on the
Banks, and in the harbours. Towards
which country, <i>Phillips</i> making his way,
took one <i>Salter</i> in a Sloop on the Isle of
<i>Sables</i>, which he kept, and gave <i>Mortimer&rsquo;s</i>
Ship to the Mate and crew; also a Schooner,
one <i>Chadwell</i> Master, which they scuttled in
order to sink: But <i>Phillips</i> understanding
that she belonged to Mr. <i>Menors</i> of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg&nbsp;84]</a></span>
<i>Newfoundland</i>, with whose Vessel they first went
off a-Pirating, said, <em>We have done him injury
enough already</em>, and so ordering his Vessel to
be repaired, returned her to the Master.</p>

<p>In the Afternoon, they chased another
vessel, whose Master was an Inward Light
Man, named <i>Dependence Ellery</i>, who told
<i>Phillips</i> he took him for a Pirate as soon as
he saw him, otherwise he would not have
given him the Trouble of chasing him so
long. This so provoked <i>Phillips</i> and his
Crew, that they made poor <i>Dependence</i>, for
his Integrity, dance about the Ship till he
was weary. After which they took 10 other
ships and vessels; and on the 14th of <i>April</i>,
they took a Sloop belonging to Cape <i>Anne</i>,
<i>Andrew Harradine</i> Master; which looking
upon to be more fit for their purpose, they
came on board, keeping only the Master of
her Prisoner, and sending the crew away
in <i>Salter&rsquo;s</i> vessel. <i>Cheesman</i> broke his mind
to <i>Harradine</i>, to destroy the crew. Upon
this, it was concluded to be 12 a Clock at
Noon, when <i>Cheesman</i> leaves his working-tools
on the deck, as if he had been going
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg&nbsp;85]</a></span>
to use them, walks off. But perceiving some
signs of fear in <i>Harradine</i>, he fetches his
brandy bottle, and gives him and the rest
a dram, saying, <em>Here&rsquo;s to our next Meeting</em>;
then he talks to <i>Nutt</i>, in the mean while
<i>Philamore</i> takes up an axe, while <i>Cheesman</i>
and <i>Harradine</i> seize <i>Nutt</i> by the Collar,
and toss him over the Side of the Vessel.</p>

<p>By this Time the Boatswain was dead;
for as soon as <i>Philamore</i> saw the Master laid
hold on, he up with the axe, and cut off the
Boatswain&rsquo;s head, which Noise soon brought
the Captain upon Deck, whom <i>Cheesman</i>
saluted with the blow of a mallet, which
broke his jaw-bone, but did not knock him
down; upon which <i>Harradine</i> came to the
Carpenter&rsquo;s aid, when <i>Sparks</i> the Gunner
interposing, <i>Cheesman</i> trips up his Heels,
and flung him into the arms of <i>Charles
Ivemay</i>, who at that moment threw him
into the Sea; and at the same Time <i>Harradine</i>
throws Captain <i>Phillips</i> after him, bidding
the Devil take them both. This done,
<i>Cheesman</i> jumps from the deck into the
Hold, to knock <i>Archer</i> on the Head, when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg&nbsp;86]</a></span>
<i>Harry Gyles</i> came down after him, desired
his Life might be spared; which being agreed
to, he was made a Prisoner, and secured.</p>

<p>All being over, they altered their course
from <i>Newfoundland</i> to <i>Boston</i>, where they
arrived the 3rd of <i>May</i>, to the great joy of
the Province, and on the 12th of <i>May</i>, a
special Court of Admiralty was held for the
Trial of these Pirates, when <i>John Philamore</i>,
<i>Edward Cheesman</i>, <i>John Cobs</i>, <i>Henry Gyles</i>,
<i>Charles Joymay</i>, <i>John Bootman</i>, and <i>Henry
Payne</i>, were honourably acquitted; as also
three <i>French</i> Men, <i>John Baptis</i>, <i>Peter Taffery</i>,
and <i>Isaac Lassen</i>, as also three Negroes,
<i>Pedro</i>, <i>Francisco</i>, and <i>Pierro</i>. <i>John Rose Archer</i>,
the Quarter-Master, <i>William White</i>, <i>William
Taylor</i>, and <i>William Phillips</i> were condemned;
altho&rsquo; the two latter got a Reprieve, and the
two former, <i>Archer</i> and <i>White</i>, were executed
the 2nd of <i>June</i> following.</p>

<h2>CAPTAIN TEACH, <i>ALIAS</i>
BLACKBEARD</h2>


<p><i>Edward Teach</i> was a <i>Bristol</i> Man, and had
served many years in the late wars, in a
Privateer fitted out from <i>Jamaica</i>, in which
he had often distinguished himself for his
boldness. He was never thought fit to be
entrusted with any Command, till he went
a-pirating in the Year 1716, when Captain
<i>Benjamin Hornigold</i> put him into a Prize
Sloop, with whom he kept company till
<i>Hornigold</i> surrendered.</p>

<p>In 1727, <i>Teach</i> and <i>Hornigold</i> sailed from
<i>Providence</i> for <i>America</i>, where, in their way,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg&nbsp;90]</a></span>
they took a vessel with above 100 Barrels
of Flour, as also a Sloop from <i>Bermudas</i>,
and a Ship bound to <i>Carolina</i>; from which
they had a good plunder. After cleaning at
<i>Virginia</i>, they returned to the <i>West-Indies</i>,
and made Prize of a <i>French Guinea</i> Man
bound to <i>Martinico</i>, which <i>Teach</i> was made
Captain of; but <i>Hornigold</i> with his Sloop
returned to <i>Providence</i>, and surrendered to
mercy. Aboard the <i>French Guinea</i> Ship,
<i>Teach</i> mounted 46 guns, and called her
<i>Queen Anne&rsquo;s Revenge</i>. Not long after he
fell in with the <i>Scarborough</i> Man-of-War,
who, after a long fight finding she could do
no good with <i>Teach</i>, left him, and returned
to <i>Barbadoes</i>, while <i>Teach</i> sailed to <i>Spanish
America</i>. In his way, he met with Major
<i>Bonnet</i> a Gentleman, formerly of a good
estate in <i>Barbadoes</i>, in a small Sloop with
which he had turned Pirate: But <i>Teach</i>
finding <i>Bonnet</i> knew nothing of the matter,
took him into his own Ship, and put one
<i>Richards</i> Captain in his room, telling the
Major, <em>That he had not been us&rsquo;d to the Fatigues
of the Sea, he had better decline it, and take his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg&nbsp;91]</a></span>
pleasure aboard his Ship</em>. At <i>Turnissi</i> they
took in fresh water; but seeing a Sloop
coming in, they ran to meet her, which
struck her sail, upon the sight of the Black
Flag, to <i>Teach</i>, who took the Captain and
his men aboard, and put <i>Israel Hands</i> to
mann the Sloop: From thence they sailed
to the Bay, where they found a ship and
four Sloops. <i>Teach</i> hoisted his Black Colours,
at the Sight of which, the Captain and his
men left the Ship, and ran into the woods.
<i>Teach&rsquo;s</i> Quarter-Master, with some of his
Men, took possession of her, and <i>Richards</i>
secured the Sloops: One of which they
burnt, because she belonged to <i>Boston</i>,
where some of his Men had been hanged;
but the others they let go after plundering
them.</p>

<p>From hence they sailed to the <i>Grand
Canaries</i>, then to the <i>Bahama</i> Wrecks,
and then to <i>Carolina</i>, where they took a
Brigantine and two Sloops, lying off the Bar
of <i>Charles Town</i>; as also a Ship bound for
<i>London</i>, with some passengers aboard.
The next Day they took another Vessel
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg&nbsp;92]</a></span>
coming out, and two Pinks going in, and a
Brigantine with negroes, in the Face of the
Town; which put the Inhabitants into a
sad fright, being in no condition to help
themselves.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 94px;">

</div>

<p><i>Teach</i>, alias <i>Blackbeard</i>, sent <i>Richards</i> along
with Mr. <i>Mark</i>, one of the Prisoners, to demand
a chest of medicines of the Governor,
several of his Men being sick
aboard; threatening otherwise to
burn the Ships, and destroy all the
prisoners, among whom was Mr.
<i>Samuel Wrag</i>, one of his Council.
Altho&rsquo; this went very much against
the inhabitants, yet they were forced
to comply with it to save the lives
of the many souls had in his custody. So
sending him a chest worth about 3 or 4
hundred Pounds, <i>Richards</i> went back safe
to the ships with his booty; which as
soon as <i>Blackbeard</i> had received, (for so
I shall call him for the future) he let
the ships and the prisoners go, having
first taken 1500<i>l.</i> Sterling, and some provisions
out of her. From thence they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg&nbsp;93]</a></span>
sailed to North <i>Carolina</i>, where he had
thoughts of breaking up the company, and
securing the money and the best of the
effects for himself and friends. Accordingly
he ran a-ground, as if it had been
by accident, and calling <i>Israel Hands</i> to
his assistance, he ran the Sloop ashore
near the other, and so they were both
lost. This done <i>Blackbeard</i> goes into
the <i>Revenge</i> and maroons 17 men upon a
desert island; where they must inevitably
have perished, if <i>Bonnet</i> had not after
taken them up.</p>

<p><i>Blackbeard</i> goes straight to the Governor
of <i>North Carolina</i>, with Twenty of his Men,
and pleads his Majesty&rsquo;s Pardon, and receives
Certificates thereupon. He went to
his Sloop which lay at <i>Okere-Cock</i> Inlet, and
set out for Sea upon another expedition,
steering his Ship towards <i>Bermudas</i>. Meeting
with one or two <i>English Vessels</i> in his
way, he robb&rsquo;d them only of provisions for
his present occasion; but meeting with a
<i>French</i> Ship laden with sugar and cocoa,
he brought her home with her cargoe to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg&nbsp;94]</a></span>
<i>North Carolina</i>, where the Governor and
the Pirates shared the plunder. He had
no sooner arrived there, but he and four of
his Men made affidavit, That they found the
<i>French</i> Ship at Sea, without ever a Man on
board; upon which she was condemned.
The Governor had sixty hogheads of sugar
for his dividend, his Secretary twenty, and
the rest were shared amongst the other
Pirates. And for fear the ship might be
discovered by some that might come into
the River, <i>Blackbeard</i>, under pretence that
she was leaky, and might sink, obtained an
order from the Governor to bring her out
into the River, and burn her; which they
did, and sunk her bottom.</p>

<p>The Sloops trading in the River, being so
often pillaged by <i>Blackbeard</i>, consulted with
the traders what course to take, knowing it
was in vain to make any application to the
Governor; therefore they sent a deputation
to the Governor of <i>Virginia</i>, to sollicit a
force from the Men-of-War to destroy this
Pirate. Accordingly the Governor consulted
with the Captains of the <i>Pearl</i> and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg&nbsp;95]</a></span>
<i>Lime</i> Men-of-War, which lay in <i>St. James&rsquo;s</i>
River; whereupon it was agreed, That the
Governor should have a couple of small
Sloops, and they should be mann&rsquo;d out of
the Men of War, the Command of which
was given to Mr. <i>Robert Maynard</i>, first
Lieutenant of the <i>Pearl</i>. But before they
sailed, it was agreed in Council, to offer a
reward of 100<i>l.</i> for <em>any one that should take
<span class="roman">Edward Teach</span>, commonly called <span class="roman">Blackbeard;
for every</span> Lieutenant, Master, Quarter-Master,
Boatswain, <span class="roman">or</span> Carpenter Twenty Pounds;
For every inferior Officer, Fifteen Pounds; And
for every Man taken on Board each Sloop, Ten
Pounds</em>.</p>

<p>Upon this, the Lieutenant sailed from
<i>James&rsquo;s</i> River in <i>Virginia</i>, the 17th of
<i>November</i>, 1718, and the 21st in the evening
came to <i>Okere-cock</i> Inlet, where he had fight
of the Pirate: And altho&rsquo; this Expedition
was made with all the Secrecy imaginable,
yet <i>Blackbeard</i> had notice of it from the
Governor of North <i>Carolina</i> and his Secretary:
But having heard several false
reports before, he gave the less credit
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg&nbsp;96]</a></span>
to this, till he saw the Sloops; and then he
put himself in a Posture of defence, with
his 25 Men.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <i>Maynard</i> came to an anchor
that night, because the Channel was so
intricate that there was no getting in, in the
dark. In the Morning, coming within gun-shot
of the Pirate, he received his fire:
whereupon the <i>Maynard</i> stood directly towards
him, endeavouring to make a running
fight. <i>Maynard&rsquo;s</i> men being most expos&rsquo;d,
he lost twenty at one broadside; upon
which he ordered his men under deck,
and bid them get ready for close fighting
upon the first signal. Then <i>Blackbeard&rsquo;s</i>
men pour&rsquo;d in grenadoes; after which,
seeing no Hands aboard, he told his men
they were all kill&rsquo;d; <em>Let&rsquo;s jump in, and fall to
Plunder</em>: Which they had no sooner done,
but the Lieutenant and his men gave them
as unwelcome a reception as ever they met
with before. The Lieutenant and <i>Blackbeard</i>
fired first at each other, and then they went
to it sword in hand, whilst the men on
each side were as warmly engaged as their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg&nbsp;97]</a></span>
Captains, until the vessel was all over
blood. <i>Blackbeard</i> stood it till he had received
above twenty wounds, five of them being
shots, before he fell down dead. Eight of
his fourteen men being kill&rsquo;d, and the other
six being much wounded, they call&rsquo;d for
quarters; which was granted, and then the
Lieutenant attacked with equal bravery the
men that remained in the Sloop and took
them.</p>

<p>The Lieutenant caused <i>Blackbeard&rsquo;s</i> head
to be cut off, and hung at the bowsprit end;
with which he sailed to <i>Bath Town</i> to get
his wounded men cured, and then began to
rummage the Pirate Sloop, aboard which
they found several Letters of Correspondence
betwixt the Governor of <i>North
Carolina</i>, his Secretary, and some Traders
of <i>New York</i> and <i>Blackbeard</i>. Thereupon
going to <i>Bath Town</i> in <i>North Carolina</i>, he
seized in the Governors Store-house, the
Sixty Hogsheads of Sugar, and Mr. <i>Knight</i>
his Secretary&rsquo;s 20, which was their dividend
of the plunder taken in the <i>French</i> Ship
before-mentioned.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg&nbsp;98]</a></span>
After his Men were a little recovered, he
returned to the Men-of-War in <i>James&rsquo;s</i> River
in <i>Virginia</i>, with <i>Blackbeard&rsquo;s</i> head hanging
at his bowsprit, and 15 prisoners, 13 of
whom were hanged, one of them being
taken but the night before out of a trading
Sloop: The other, not being in the fight,
was taken at <i>Bath Town</i>, being just before
disabled by <i>Blackbeard</i> in one of his drunken
humours.</p>

<p>The night before he was killed, being
ask&rsquo;d if he should chance to be killed,
whether his wife knew where his money
was; he answered, <em>That no-body but himself
and the Devil, knew where it was, and the
longest Liver should take all</em>.</p>

<h2>MAJOR STEDE BONNET,
AND HIS CREW</h2>


<p>The Major was a Gentleman of Fortune
and Distinction in the Island of <i>Barbadoes</i>,
who before his Piracy bore the character
of a worthy honest <em>man</em>, and no-body
could ever account for this his undertaking,
for he wanted neither learning nor understanding.
He fitted out a Sloop with ten
guns and sixty men, which he named the
<i>Revenge</i>, at his own expence, and sailed
from <i>Barbadoes</i> for the Cape of <i>Virginia</i>,
where he took the <i>Anne</i> from <i>Glasgow</i>, the
<i>Turbet</i> from <i>Barbadoes</i>, the <i>Endeavour</i> from
<i>Bristol</i>, the <i>Young</i> from <i>Leith</i>, and many
others. From thence he went to <i>New York</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg&nbsp;104]</a></span>
and there took a Sloop, and then stood in
at <i>Gardiner&rsquo;s</i> Island where he bought provisions,
and went off. <i>August</i>, 1717, he came
off at the Bar of <i>South Carolina</i>, and took a
Sloop and Brigantine, which they plundered,
and then he dismissed the Brigantine, but
took the Sloop with him to an Inlet in <i>North-Carolina</i>,
where he careened, and set her
on fire.</p>

<p>Afterwards he put to sea, but could not
agree with the men what course to take;
for the Major being no sailor, was obliged
to submit to many things his men imposed
upon him, when falling in with <i>Edward Teach</i>,
alias <i>Blackbeard</i>, who was a good sailor, but
a hardened villain, <i>Bonnet&rsquo;s</i> Crew joined
with him, and put <i>Bonnet</i> aboard <i>Blackbeard&rsquo;s</i>
Ship.</p>

<p>But <i>Blackbeard</i> losing his Ship at <i>Topsail</i>
Inlet, surrendered to the King&rsquo;s Proclamation;
when <i>Bonnet</i> re-assumed the command
of his own Sloop, and sailed directly for
<i>Bath</i> Town in <i>North-Carolina</i>, where he also
surrenders himself, and receives a certificate.
There getting a clearance for his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg&nbsp;105]</a></span>
Sloop, he pretended to sail for the Island
of <i>St. Thomas</i>, to get the Emperor&rsquo;s Commission
to go a-Privateering upon the
<i>Spaniards</i>. But returning to <i>Topsail</i> Inlet,
he found that <i>Blackbeard</i> and his gang were
gone, with their effects; and that they had
set on shore, on a small sandy island about
a league from the continent, seventeen
men, without any provisions, or vessel to
escape. There they had been two nights
and one day without any sustenance, when,
to their inexpressible joy, they saw Major
<i>Bonnet</i>, who had been informed of their
being there by two of <i>Blackbeard&rsquo;s</i> crew,
who had escaped to avoid his cruelty.</p>

<p>Then he steered his course towards
<i>Virginia</i>, where meeting with a Pink having
Provisions on board, and they being in want,
he took out of her ten barrels of pork, and
five hundredweight of bread, and gave her,
in exchange, ten casks of Rice, and an old
cable.</p>

<p>Two days after they took a Sloop of
sixty tons, from which they took two
hogsheads of rum, and two of molasses,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg&nbsp;106]</a></span>
and then put in her eight men, to take care
of the Prize; but they not liking her new
acquaintance took the first opportunity to
get off with her.</p>

<p>After this the Major threw off all restraint,
and became a downright Pirate, by
the name of Captain <i>Thomas</i>, taking and
plundering all the vessels he met with. He
took off Cape <i>Henry</i>, two Ships from <i>Virginia</i>,
bound to <i>Glasgow</i>; the next day a small
Sloop from <i>Virginia</i> bound to <i>Bermudas</i>;
from which they took twenty barrels of
pork, and gave her in return, two barrels
of rice, and as much molasses. The next
day they took another <i>Virginia</i> man, bound
to <i>Glasgow</i>, out of which they took two men,
and a few small things, and gave her a
barrel of pork, and another of bread.
From thence they sailed to <i>Philadelphia</i>,
where they took a Schooner coming from
<i>North Carolina</i> to <i>Boston</i>, from which they
took two men, and two dozen of calves
skins, to make covers for guns. In the
latitude of 32&deg;, off of <i>Delaware</i> River, near
<i>Philadelphia</i>, they took two Snows bound to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg&nbsp;107]</a></span>
<i>Bristol</i>, from which they took money and
goods to the value of two hundred pounds;
as also a Sloop of sixty tons, from <i>Philadelphia</i>
to <i>Barbadoes</i>, from which they took
a few goods, and let her go. The 29th of
<i>July</i>, they took a Sloop of fifty tons, bound
from <i>Philadelphia</i> to <i>Barbadoes</i>, laden with
provisions, which they kept; as also another
of sixty tons, from <i>Antegoa</i> to <i>Philadelphia</i>,
having on board, rum, molasses, sugar,
cotton and indigo, to the value of five hundred
Pounds, all of which they kept. Then
they left <i>Delaware</i> Bay, and sailed to Cape
<i>Fear</i> River, where they staid almost two
months to repair their Sloop, which proved
very leaky, till news came to <i>Carolina</i> of a
Pirate&rsquo;s Sloop, with her Prizes, being there
a-careening.</p>

<p>Whereupon Colonel <i>William Rhet</i> offered
to go with two Sloops to attack them; which
being by the Governor and Council approved
of, he was commissioned on board
the <i>Henry</i>, with eight guns and seventy
men, commanded by Captain <i>John Masters</i>;
and the <i>Sea Nymph</i>, commanded by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg&nbsp;108]</a></span>
Captain Farier-Hall, with as many guns
and men; both under the Direction of the
Colonel, who went on board the <i>Henry</i> the
14th of <i>September</i>, and sailed from <i>Charles</i>
Town to <i>Swillivant&rsquo;s</i> Island, in order to
cruise: where he was informed, by a small
ship from <i>Antegoa</i>, which in sight of the
Bar, was taken and plundered by <i>Charles
Vane</i>, in a Brigantine of sixteen guns, and
a hundred men; that he had taken two
Sloops, one Captain <i>Dill</i>, Master, from
<i>Barbadoes</i>; the other Captain <i>Thompson</i>,
from <i>Guinea</i>, with seventy negroes, which
they put on board one <i>Yeats</i> his consort,
being a small Sloop with twenty-five men,
who being weary of this course of life, ran
into <i>Edisto</i> River, and surrender&rsquo;d to his
Majesty&rsquo;s Pardon, by which the owners
got their negroes again, and <i>Yeats</i> and his
men had their certificates sign&rsquo;d.</p>

<p><i>Vane</i> cruised for some time thereabouts,
in hopes to take <i>Yeats</i>, and be revenged on
him; during which time, he took a ship
bound to London, to whom he gave out,
that he designed to go to the southward;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg&nbsp;109]</a></span>
which Colonel <i>Rhet</i> hearing, sailed over the
Bar the 15th with the two Sloops, and went
after the Pirate <i>Vane</i>; but not meeting with
him, tack&rsquo;d and stood for Cape <i>Fear</i>, according
to his first Design; and on the 26th
following he entered the River, where he
saw <i>Bonnet</i>, and the three Sloops his Prizes,
at anchor; but the Pilot running the Sloops
a-ground, hindered their getting up that
Night. The Pirates seeing the Sloops, and
not knowing who they were, mann&rsquo;d three
canoes, and sent them down to take them;
but finding their mistake, <i>Bonnet</i> took all
the men out of the Prizes to engage them.
Colonel <i>Rhet&rsquo;s</i> Sloops the next morning
getting under sail, stood for the Pirates,
who designed only to make a running fight;
but the Colonel getting upon his quarters,
he edged in upon the shore, and ran his
Sloop a-ground. The Colonel&rsquo;s Sloops were
soon in the same condition: The <i>Henry</i>
grounded within pistol-shot of the Pirate,
on his bow; the other, right a-head of him,
almost out of gun-shot, which made it of but
very little use to the Colonel. By this time
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg&nbsp;110]</a></span>
the Pirate had a very great advantage: For
his Sloop lifted from Colonel <i>Rhet&rsquo;s</i>, which
converted them all over; and the Colonel&rsquo;s
Sloop lifting the same way, was much
exposed for about five hours, whilst they
lay a-ground. The Colonel&rsquo;s Sloop being
first a-float, he got into deeper water, and
after mending his rigging, he stood for the
Pirate, to go directly on board him; which
they prevented, by hoisting a flag of truce,
and surrendering soon after. The Colonel
lost in this action ten men, and had fourteen
wounded. The <i>Sea Nymph</i> had two
killed, and four wounded. Among the
Pirates were none killed, and three were
wounded. The next day the Colonel
weighed from Cape <i>Fear</i>, and arrived at
<i>Charles Town</i> the 3d of <i>October</i>, to the no
small joy of the people of <i>Carolina</i>.</p>

<p>There being no publick prison, <i>Bonnet</i>
was committed into the custody of the
marshal, and his Men were kept at the
Watch-house under a strict guard; a little
before the trial, <i>David Harriot</i> the Master,
and <i>Ignatius Rathe</i> Boatswain, the evidences,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg&nbsp;111]</a></span>
were removed from the Crew, to the Marshal&rsquo;s
house, from whence on the 24th
<i>Bonnet</i> and <i>Harriott</i> made their escape;
which as soon as the Governor heard of,
he published a Proclamation, promising a
reward of 700<i>l.</i> to any one that would take
him, and also sent several boats with armed
men in pursuit of him.</p>

<p><i>Bonnet</i> stood to the northward, in a small
vessel; but through stress of weather, and
want of necessaries, he was forced to <i>Swillivant&rsquo;s</i>
Island. Of which information being
given to the Governor, he sent for Colonel
<i>Rhet</i>, and desired him once more to go in
pursuit of him; which the Colonel readily
accepted of; and having got all Things ready,
went that Night for <i>Swillivant&rsquo;s</i> Island,
where, after a long search, he discovered
them. After the Colonel&rsquo;s men had fired
upon them, and killed <i>Harriott</i>, <i>Bonnet</i> immediately
surrendered himself, and was, next
Morning, brought back to <i>Charles Town</i>, and
confined under a strong guard till his trial,
which was hastened for fear he should give
them the slip again.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg&nbsp;112]</a></span>
On the 28th of <i>October</i>, 1718, a Court of
Vice-Admiralty was held at <i>Charles Town</i>,
and, by several adjournments continued to
the 12th of <i>November</i> following, by <i>Nicholas
Trot</i>, Esq; Judge of the Vice-Admiralty,
and Chief Judge of <i>Carolina</i>, and other
Assistant Judges; where, after the King&rsquo;s
Commission was read, and a Grand Jury
sworn, <i>Judge Trot</i> gave them a learned
Charge: And then the <i>Grand Jury</i> went
out, and found the Bills; upon which, a

they having all shared ten or eleven Pounds

found Guilty. After which the Judge set
forth the enormity of their Crimes: And

<h2>CAPTAIN WILLIAM KID</h2>


<p>We are now going to give an account of one
whose name is better known in <i>England</i>,
than most of those whose histories we have
already related; the person we mean is
Captain <i>Kid</i>, whose public Trial and Execution
here, rendered him the subject of
all conversation.</p>

<p>In the beginning of King <i>William&rsquo;s</i> War,
Captain <i>Kid</i> commanded a Privateer in the
<i>West-Indies</i>, and by several adventurous
actions acquired the reputation of a brave
man, as well as an experienced seaman.
About this time the Pirates were very
troublesome in those parts, wherefore
Captain <i>Kid</i> was recommended by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg&nbsp;120]</a></span>
Lord <i>Bellamont</i>, then Governor of <i>Barbadoes</i>,
as well as by several other persons,
to the Government here, as a person very
fit to be entrusted with the command of
a Government Ship, and to be employed in
cruising upon the Pirates, as knowing those
Seas perfectly well, and being acquainted
with their lurking places; but what reasons
governed the politics of those times, I
cannot tell, but this proposal met with no
encouragement here, though it is certain it
would have been of great consequence to
the subject, our merchants suffering incredible
damages by those robbers.</p>

<p>Upon this neglect the Lord <i>Bellamont</i>,
and some others who knew what great
captures had been made by the Pirates,
and what a prodigious wealth must be in
their possession, were tempted to fit out a
ship at their own private charge, and to
give the command of it to Captain <i>Kid</i>;
and to give the thing a greater reputation,
as well as to keep their seamen under the
better command, they procured the King&rsquo;s
Commission for the said Captain <i>Kid</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg&nbsp;121]</a></span>
Captain <i>Kid</i> had also another Commission,
which was called a Commission
of Reprisals; for it being then War time,
this Commission was to justify him in the
taking of <i>French</i> Merchant Ships, in case he
should meet with any. He sail&rsquo;d out of
<i>Plymouth</i> in <i>May</i> 1696, in the <i>Adventure</i>
Galley of thirty guns, and eighty men; the
place he first design&rsquo;d for was <i>New York</i>;
in his Voyage thither he took a French
<i>Banker</i>, but this was no Act of Piracy, he
having a Commission for that purpose, as
we have just observed.</p>

<p>When he arrived at <i>New York</i> he put up
Articles for engaging more Hands, it being
necessary to his Ship&rsquo;s crew, since he proposed
to deal with a desperate enemy: The
terms he offered were, that every man should
have a share of what was taken, reserving
for himself and Owners forty shares. Upon
this encouragement he soon increas&rsquo;d his
company to a hundred and fifty five men.</p>

<p>With this company he first sail&rsquo;d for
<i>Maderas</i>, where he took in wine and some
other necessaries; from thence he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg&nbsp;122]</a></span>
proceeded to <i>Bonavist</i>, one of the <i>Cape de Verd
Islands</i>, to furnish the ship with salt, and
from thence went immediately to <i>St. Jago</i>,
another of the <i>Cape de Verd Islands</i>, in order
to stock himself with provisions. When all
this was done, he bent his course to <i>Madagascar</i>,
the known rendezvous of Pirates; in
this way he fell in with Captain <i>Warren</i>,
Commodore of three Men-of-War; he
acquainted them with his design, kept
them company two or three days, and
then leaving them, made the best way for
<i>Madagascar</i>, where he arrived in <i>February</i>
1696, just nine months from his departure
from <i>Plymouth</i>.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/pirates42.png" width="250" height="250"
alt="Sketch portrait of a pirate" />
</div>

<p>It does not appear all this while that he
had the least design of turning Pirate; for
near <i>Mahala</i> and <i>Joanna</i> both
he met with several <i>Indian</i> ships
richly laden, to which he did not
offer the least violence, tho&rsquo; he
was strong enough to have done
what he pleas&rsquo;d with them; and
the first outrage or depredation I find he
committed upon mankind, was after his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg&nbsp;123]</a></span>
repairing his ship, and leaving <i>Joanna</i>; he
touch&rsquo;d at a place call&rsquo;d <i>Mabbee</i>, upon the
<i>Red Sea</i>, where he took some <i>Guinea</i> Corn
from the natives, by force.</p>

<p>After this he sail&rsquo;d to <i>Bab&rsquo;s Key</i>, a Place
upon a little Island at the entrance of the
<i>Red Sea</i>; here it was that he first began to
open himself to his ship&rsquo;s company, and let
them understand that he intended to change
his measures; for, happening to talk of the
<i>Moca</i> Fleet, which was to sail that way, he
said <em>We have been unsuccessful hitherto, but
courage, my Boys, we&rsquo;ll make our fortunes out
of this Fleet</em>: And finding that none of them
appear&rsquo;d averse to it, he order&rsquo;d a boat out,
well mann&rsquo;d, to go upon the coast to make
discoveries, commanding them to take a
prisoner and bring to him, or get intelligence
any way they could. The boat
return&rsquo;d in a few days, bringing him word,
that they saw fourteen or fifteen ships ready
to sail, some with <i>English</i>, some with <i>Dutch</i>,
and some with <i>Moorish</i> Colours. He therefore
order&rsquo;d a man continually to watch at
the mast-head, least this Fleet should go
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg&nbsp;124]</a></span>
by them; and about four days after, towards
evening, it appear&rsquo;d in sight, being convoy&rsquo;d
by one <i>English</i> and one <i>Dutch</i> Man-of-War.
<i>Kid</i> soon fell in with them, and getting into
the midst of them, fir&rsquo;d at a <i>Moorish</i> ship
which was next him; but the Men-of-War
taking the Alarm, bore down upon <i>Kid</i>, and
firing upon him, obliged him to sheer off,
he not being strong enough to contend with
them. Now he had begun hostilities, he
resolv&rsquo;d to go on, and therefore he went and
cruis&rsquo;d along the coast of <i>Malabar</i>; the first
Prize he met was a small vessel belonging
to <i>Aden</i>, the vessel was <i>Moorish</i>, and the
Owners were <i>Moorish</i> Merchants, but the
Master was an <i>Englishman</i>, his name was
<i>Parker</i>. <i>Kid</i> forc&rsquo;d him and a <i>Portugueze</i> that
was call&rsquo;d <i>Don Antonio</i>, which were all the
<i>Europeans</i> on Board, to take on with them;
the first he design&rsquo;d as a pilot, and the last
as an interpreter. He also used the men
very cruelly, causing them to be hoisted up
by the arms, and drubb&rsquo;d with a naked
cutlass, to force them to discover whether
they had money on board, and where it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg&nbsp;125]</a></span>
lay; but as they had neither gold nor
silver on board, he got nothing by his
cruelty; however, he took from them a
bale of pepper, and a bale of coffee, and
so let them go.</p>

<p>Soon after this he came up with a <i>Moorish</i>
Ship, the Master whereof was a <i>Dutchman</i>,
call&rsquo;d <i>Schipper Mitchel</i>, and chased her under
<i>French</i> Colours, which they observing, hoisted
<i>French</i> Colours too: When he came up with
her, he hail&rsquo;d her in <i>French</i>, and they having
a <i>Frenchman</i> on board, answer&rsquo;d him in
the same language; upon which he order&rsquo;d
them to send their boat on board; they
were oblig&rsquo;d to do so, and having examin&rsquo;d
who they were, and from whence they
came; he ask&rsquo;d the <i>Frenchman</i>, who was
a passenger, if he had a <i>French</i> pass for
himself? The <i>Frenchman</i> gave him to
understand that he had. Then he told the
<i>Frenchman</i> he must pass for Captain, <em>and
by God</em>, says he, <em>you are the Captain</em>: The
<i>Frenchman</i> durst not refuse doing as he
would have him: The meaning of this was,
that he would seize the Ship as fair Prize,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg&nbsp;126]</a></span>
and as if she belonged to <i>French</i> Subjects,
according to a commission he had for that
purpose; tho&rsquo;, one would think, after what
he had already done, that he need not have
recourse to a quibble to give his actions a
colour.</p>

<p>In short, he took the cargoe and sold it
some time after, yet still he seem&rsquo;d to have
some fears upon him least these proceedings
should have a bad end; for, coming up
with a <i>Dutch</i> Ship some time, when his
men thought of nothing but attacking her,
<i>Kid</i> oppos&rsquo;d it; upon which a mutiny arose,
and the majority being for taking the said
ship, and arming themselves to man the
boat to go and seize her, he told them, such
as did, never should come on Board him
again; which put an end to the design, so
that he kept company with the said ship
some time, without offering her any
violence: However, this dispute was the
occasion of an accident, upon which an
indictment was afterwards grounded against
<i>Kid</i>; for <i>Moor</i>, the Gunner, being one day
upon deck, and talking with <i>Kid</i> about the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg&nbsp;127]</a></span>
said <i>Dutch</i> Ship, some words arose betwixt
them, and <i>Moor</i> told <i>Kid</i>, that he had ruin&rsquo;d
them all; upon which, <i>Kid</i>, calling him <em>Dog</em>,
took up a bucket and struck him with it,
which breaking his skull, he died the next
day.</p>

<p>But <i>Kid&rsquo;s</i> penitential fit did not last long,
for coasting along <i>Malabar</i>, he met with
a great number of boats, all which he
plunder&rsquo;d. Upon the same Coast he also
lit upon a <i>Portugueze</i> Ship, which he kept
possession of a week, and then having
taking out of her some chests of <i>Indian</i>
goods, thirty jars of butter, and some
wax, iron, and a hundred bags of rice, he
let her go.</p>

<p>The <i>Adventure</i> Galley was now so old
and leaky, that they were forced to keep
two pumps continually going, wherefore
<i>Kid</i> shifted all the guns and tackle out of
her into the <i>Queda</i> Merchant, intending her
for his Man-of-War; and as he had divided
the Money before, he now made a division
of the remainder of the cargo: Soon after
which, the greatest part of the company
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg&nbsp;128]</a></span>
left him, some going on board Captain
<i>Culliford</i>, and others absconding in the
Country, so that he had not above forty
men left.</p>

<p>He put to sea and happened to touch at
<i>Amboyna</i>, one of the <i>Dutch</i> Spice Islands,
where he was told, that the news of his
Actions had reach&rsquo;d <i>England</i>, and that he
was there declared a Pirate.</p>

<p>The truth on&rsquo;t is, his Piracies so alarmed
our Merchants, that some motions were
made in Parliament, to enquire into the
commission that was given him, and the
persons who fitted him out: These proceedings
seem&rsquo;d to lean a little hard upon
the Lord <i>Bellamont</i>, who thought himself so
much touch&rsquo;d thereby, that he published a
Justification of himself in a pamphlet after
<i>Kid&rsquo;s</i> execution. In the mean time, it was
thought advisable, to publish a Proclamation,
offering the King&rsquo;s free Pardon to all
such Pirates as should voluntarily surrender
themselves, whatever Piracies they had
been guilty of at any time, before the last
day of <i>April</i>, 1699&mdash;That is to say, for all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg&nbsp;129]</a></span>
Piracies committed Eastward of the <i>Cape of
Good</i> Hope, to the Longitude and Meridian
of <i>Socatora</i>, and <i>Cape Camorin</i>. In which
Proclamation, <i>Avery</i> and <i>Kid</i> were excepted
by Name.</p>

<p>When <i>Kid</i> left <i>Amboyna</i> he knew nothing
of this Proclamation, for certainly had he
had notice of his being excepted in it, he
would not have been so infatuated, to run
himself into the very jaws of danger; but
relying upon his interest with the Lord
<i>Bellamont</i>, and fancying, that a <i>French</i> Pass
or two he found on board some of the ships
he took, would serve to countenance the
matter, and that part of the booty he got
would gain him new friends&mdash;I say, all
these things made him flatter himself that
all would be hushed, and that justice would
but wink at him. Wherefor he sail&rsquo;d directly
for <i>New York</i>, where he was no sooner
arrived, but by the Lord <i>Bellamont&rsquo;s</i> orders,
he was secured with all his papers and
effects. Many of his fellow-adventurers
who had forsook him at <i>Madagascar</i>, came
over from thence passengers, some to <i>New
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg&nbsp;130]</a></span>
England</i> and some to <i>Jersey</i>; where hearing
of the King&rsquo;s Proclamation for pardoning
of Pirates, they surrendered themselves to
the Governor of those places: At first they
were admitted to bail, but soon after were
laid in strict confinement, where they were
kept for some time, till an opportunity
happened of sending them with their Captain
over to <i>England</i> to be tried.</p>

<p>Accordingly a Sessions of Admiralty
being held at the <i>Old Baily</i>, in <i>May</i>, 1701,
<i>Captain Kid</i>, <i>Nicholas Churchill</i>, <i>James How</i>,
<i>Robert Lumley</i>, <i>William Jenkins</i>, <i>Gabriel Loff</i>,
<i>Hugh Parrot</i>, <i>Richard Barlicorn</i>, <i>Abel Owens</i>,
and <i>Darby Mullins</i>, were arraingn&rsquo;d for
Piracy and Robbery on the High Seas,
and all found guilty, except three; these
were <i>Robert Lumley</i>, <i>William Jenkins</i>, and
<i>Richard Barlicorn</i>, who proving themselves
to be apprentices to some of the
officers of the ship, and producing their
Indentures in Court, were acquitted.</p>

<p><i>Kid</i> was tried upon an indictment of
Murder also, <i>viz.</i> for killing <i>Moor</i> the
Gunner, and found guilty of the same.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg&nbsp;131]</a></span>
<i>Nicholas Churchill</i> and <i>James How</i> pleaded
the King&rsquo;s Pardon, as having surrendered
themselves within the time limited in the
Proclamation, and Colonel <i>Bass</i>, Governor
of <i>West Jersey</i>, to whom they surrendered,
being in Court, and called upon, proved the
same; however, this plea was over-ruled by
the Court, because there being four Commissioners
named in the Proclamation, it
was adjudged no other person was qualified
to receive their surrender, and that they
could not be intitled to the benefit.</p>

<p>As to Captain <i>Kid&rsquo;s</i> Defence, he insisted
much upon his own innocence, and the
villany of his men; he said he went out
in a laudable employment and had no
occasion, being then in good circumstances,
to go a-Pirating; that the men often mutinied
against him, and did as they pleas&rsquo;d;
that he was threatened to be shot in his
cabin, and that ninety five left him at one
time, and set fire to his boat, so that he
was disabled from bringing his ship home,
or the Prizes he took, to have them regularly
condemn&rsquo;d, which he said were taken by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg&nbsp;132]</a></span>
virtue of a commission under the broad
seal, they having <i>French</i> Passes&mdash;The Captain
called one Col. <i>Hewson</i> to his Reputation,
who gave him an extraordinary
character, and declared to the Court, that
he had served under his command, and
been in two engagements with him against
the <i>French</i>, in which he fought as well as
any man he ever saw; that there were only
<i>Kid&rsquo;s</i> Ship and his own against Monsieur <i>du
Cass</i>, who commanded a squadron of six
sail, and they got the better of him, but
this being several years before the facts
mentioned in the Indictment were committed,
prov&rsquo;d of no manner of service to
the Prisoner on his Trial.</p>

<p>As to the friendship shown to <i>Culliford</i>,
a notorious Pirate, <i>Kid</i> denied, and said, he
intended to have taken him, but his men
being a parcel of rogues and villains
refused to stand by him, and several of
them ran away from his ship to the said
Pirate.&mdash;But the evidence being full and
particular against him, he was found Guilty
as before mentioned.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg&nbsp;133]</a></span>
When <i>Kid</i> was asked what he had to say
why Sentence should not pass against him,
he answered, That <em>he had nothing to say, but
that he had been sworn against by perjured
wicked People</em>. And when Sentence was
pronounced, he said, <em>My Lord it is a very
hard Sentence. For my part I am the innocentest
Person of them all, only I have been
sworn against by perjured Persons</em>.</p>

<p>Wherefore about a week after, Capt.
<i>Kid</i>, <i>Nicholas Churchill</i>, <i>James How</i>, <i>Gabriel
Loff</i>, <i>Hugh Parrot</i>, <i>Abel Owen</i>, and <i>Darby
Mullins</i>, were executed at <i>Execution Dock</i>,
and afterwards hung up in Chains, at some
distance from each other, down the river,
where their Bodies hung exposed for many
years.</p>

<h2>CAPTAIN EDWARD ENGLAND,
AND HIS CREW</h2>


<p><i>Edward England</i> went Mate of a Sloop that
sailed out of <i>Jamaica</i>, and was taken by
<i>Winter</i>, a Pirate, from whom he had the
Command of a Sloop just before their
Settlement at <i>Providence</i>. The man was
brave and good natured, and far from being
cruel, as most of them are; and would not
have committed such barbarous actions
as he did, had not his comrades compelled
him to it.</p>

<p>He sailed to the Coast of <i>Africa</i>, after the
Island of <i>Providence</i> was inhabited by the
<i>English</i>. In his Passage he took several
Ships, particularly the <i>Cadogan</i> Snow belonging
to <i>Bristol</i>, one <i>Skinner</i> Master, who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg&nbsp;138]</a></span>
was murdered by those very men who had
formerly served under him, upon a quarrel
that happened between <i>Skinner</i> and them,
about their wages: He shipped them on board
a Man-of-War, from whence they deserted,
and went on board a ship in the <i>West-Indies</i>,
where they were taken by a pirate, and
brought to <i>Providence</i>, and then they sailed
with Captain <i>England</i> a-Pirating.</p>

<p>As soon as <i>Skinner</i> came on board, he saw
his old Boatswain, who said, <em>Ah! Captain
Skinner is it you, I am much in your Debt, and
now I shall pay you in your own Coin</em>. These
words put the Captain in a panic Fear:
And indeed he had Reason enough to be
afraid, for they immediately seized him,
bound him to the Windlass, pelted him with
Glass Bottles, afterwards whipt him about
the Deck, and then said, because he had
been a good Master, he should have an
easy Death, and so shot him through the
Head; the vessel and her Cargoe being
given to <i>Howel Davis</i>.</p>

<p>After this <i>England</i> went into an <i>Harbour</i>
to clean his Ship, and also fitted up the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg&nbsp;139]</a></span>
<i>Peterborough</i>, which he called the <i>Victory</i>.
Then putting out to sea, they sailed for the
<i>East-Indies</i>, and took <i>Madagascar</i>, by the
Way. From thence, after taking in water
and provisions, they went for <i>Malabar</i>, in
the Empire of the <i>Mogul</i>. Here they took
several <i>Indian</i> Vessels, and one <i>European</i>,
a <i>Dutch</i> Ship, which they exchanged for
one of their own, and then came back to
<i>Madagascar</i>, where they sent several Hands
on shore to kill venison, and then resolved
to seek out for the remains of <i>Avery&rsquo;s</i>
Crew; but returning without success, they
being settled on the other side, they stay&rsquo;d
no longer than till they had cleaned their
ships, and then sailed to <i>Juanna</i>.</p>

<p>In the Year 1720, the <i>Bombay</i> Fleet, consisting
of four <i>Grabs</i>, the <i>London Chandois</i>,
and some other ships, carried 1000 Men
to bombard and batter <i>Gapra</i>, a fort belonging
to <i>Angria</i>, on the <i>Malabar</i> Coast; which
they not being able to do, fell in with the
Pirates, in their return to <i>Bombay</i>: But
Captain <i>Upton</i> the Commodore, having no
orders, would not engage them; which so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg&nbsp;140]</a></span>
provoked the Governor, for missing so
favourable an opportunity of cutting the
Pirates all off, that he gave the command
to Captain <i>Mackra</i>, with orders to fight
them wherever he met with them.</p>

<p>But the Pirates proceeded to the southward,
and took a small ship out of <i>Orincro</i>
Road, with a <i>Dutch</i> and two <i>Portugueze</i> Men
on board, one of which they sent to the
Captain, to inform him, that if he would
supply them with provisions and water he
should have his ship again. But the Master
would not agree to it; thereupon they sent
other persons ashore, and swore he should
be the last man they would give quarter
to, and so put directly for <i>Laccadeva</i> Island,
and arrived there in three days. But
being informed by a <i>Menchew</i>, there was
no anchor-ground there, they went to the
next Island, called <i>Melincha</i>, whence they
were driven by a storm, leaving behind
them a hundred people, and all their
water-casks: But in a week&rsquo;s time, they
regained the island, took their people on
board, and filled the water-casks.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg&nbsp;141]</a></span>
Provisions being scarce, they resolved to visit
the <i>Dutch</i> at <i>Cochin</i>, and after three days
sail, arrived off of <i>Tellechery</i>, where they
took a small Vessel belonging to Governor
<i>Adams</i>; who giving an account of Captain
<i>Mackra&rsquo;s</i> fitting out against them, put them
into a grievous passion.</p>

<p>Afterward they arrived at <i>Mauritius</i>,
where they refitted the <i>Victory</i>, and then
sailed the 5th of April for <i>Madagascar</i>,
but called first at the Island <i>Mascarine</i>, at
which they found a <i>Portugueze</i> ship of
seventy guns at anchor, disabled by a
violent storm, so that they easily became a
Prize to the Pirates. She had on board the
<i>Conde Ereceira</i> Vice-Roy of <i>Goa</i>, also they
found on board her, in diamonds only, to
the value of four millions of Dollars. They
made the Vice-Roy a prisoner; but in consideration
of his losses, accepted of a ransom
of 2000 dollars and then set him and
his followers ashore. Learning that an
<i>Ostender</i> was on the leeward of that Island,
they sailed and took her, and sent her to
<i>Madagascar</i> with news of their success,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg&nbsp;142]</a></span>
where they followed themselves soon after,
with two hundred <i>Mozambique</i> Negroes in
the <i>Portugueze</i> Ship.</p>

<p>When <i>Taylor</i> came with the <i>Portugueze</i>
Prize to <i>Madagascar</i>, they found that the
<i>Ostender</i> had made his men drunk, and
seized his ship, which they carried to the
<i>Mozambique</i>; from thence the Governor
ordered her to <i>Goa</i>. But the Pirates staid
and clean&rsquo;d the <i>Cassandra</i>, and divided very
great plunder. Some, who thought they had
got enough, staid at <i>Madagascar</i>, and the rest,
having no occasion for two ships, burnt the
<i>Victory</i>, she being leaky, and went on board
the <i>Cassandra</i>, under the Command of
Captain <i>Taylor</i>, designing to go for <i>Cochin</i>
to dispose of his diamonds, amongst his old
Friends the <i>Dutch</i>, and also to avoid the
dangers of the Men-of-War that were in
pursuit of them. But as he was preparing
to sail, and heard of four Men-of-War
coming after him; therefore he altered his
mind, and sailed for the Main of <i>Africa</i>,
and put in at <i>Delagoa</i>: But the Pirates were
surprized in the evening with some shot
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg&nbsp;143]</a></span>
from the shore. They took it for a desert
shore, but it proved otherwise; for a
few months before, the <i>Dutch East India
Company</i> had settled one hundred men
upon it, who, not being supplied with
necessaries, were reduced to about sixteen;
whom <i>Taylor</i>, upon their humble petition
took aboard, and they all became Pirates
with him.</p>

<p>Here they stayed about four months,
careened their ships, and left <i>Delagoa</i> the
latter end of <i>December</i>: But not agreeing
among themselves, they parted those who
were weary of that sort of life, went on
board the <i>Portugueze</i> Prize, and sailed for
<i>Madagascar</i>; the others went on board the
<i>Cassandra</i>, and sailed for the <i>Spanish West
Indies</i>. The <i>Mermaid</i> Man-of-War, which
was a convoy to some Merchant-men, about
30 leagues distance, would have gone to
attack them, had not the Merchants, whom
he had the care of, declar&rsquo;d their protection
was of more service than destroying the
Pirates; and so he was oblig&rsquo;d to be content
with only dispatching the news of it to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg&nbsp;144]</a></span>
<i>Jamaica</i>. This brought down the <i>Lanceston</i>,
though it was a day or two too late, for they
had just before surrendered, with all their
riches, to the Governor of <i>Porto-Bello</i>, where
they now live upon their Spoils, saying,
others would have done as much, had they
had the same opportunity; swearing, <em>That
whatever Robberies they had committed they
are not the only Rogues in the World; for that
the South-Sea<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> did more Mischief in one Year,
than they were able to do in their whole Lives</em>.</p>

<h2>CAPTAIN JOHN GOW, <i>ALIAS</i> SMITH,
AND HIS CREW</h2>


<p><i>John Gow</i>, alias <i>Smith</i>, was born at a place
called <i>Caristoun</i>, in the <i>Orkney</i> Islands, and
was brought up a sailor from his youth,
having served on board several Men-of-War,
and last of all on board the <i>Suffolk</i>,
along with <i>T. Swan</i>, who was engaged with
him in the conspiracy to murder Captain
<i>Ferneau</i>, and seize the ship and cargoe, as
they went off the <i>Texel</i>, but they were prevented
by <i>James Belvin</i>, who was led into
the secret and discovered it. Captain
<i>Ferneau</i> taking little notice of it, contented
himself with turning off <i>Swan</i>, and preferred
<i>Gow</i> to be second Mate and Gunner.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg&nbsp;148]</a></span>
They sailed on board the <i>George</i> Galley,
August the 1st, 1724, from the <i>Texel</i> to
<i>Santa Cruz</i>, having 15000<i>l.</i> on board, when
Gow designed to have seized the Ship as
they went out, but could not get a party
strong enough to join with him, till he
worked up a misunderstanding between
the Captain and part of the crew, concerning
the provisions of the ship, particularly
<i>Winter</i>, <i>Peterson</i>, <i>and Mc.Cawley</i>,
who came upon the Quarter-Deck, in
presence of the Owners, just before they
sailed, and made a long complaint against
the Captain; who assured them that if there
was any wrong done them, it was not by his
consent; and that he would enquire into it
as soon as they had unmoored the ship.</p>

<p>About eight a clock at night, Captain
<i>Ferneau</i>, as usual, called them up to prayers
in the great Cabin, and then set the watch,
and went to sleep, little thinking his end
was so near, when <i>Winter</i>, <i>Rawlisson</i>, and
<i>Melvin</i>, begun the scene of blood, <i>Gow</i>
lying snug in his hammock, as if he knew
nothing of the matter, till he saw whether
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg&nbsp;149]</a></span>
the villany would succeed, or not. <i>Winter</i>
cut the Doctor&rsquo;s throat as he was asleep in
his hammock, and then went up to <i>Melvin</i>
and <i>Rawlisson</i>, who in the mean time had
seized the Captain and cut his throat also,
but not touching the windpipe, <i>Gow</i> stept
up and shot him with a brace of bullets,
and then threw him over-board. <i>Mc.Cawley</i>
cut <i>Stephen Algiers</i> the Clerk&rsquo;s throat, as he
lay in the hammock, and <i>Williams</i> shot him
dead afterwards. <i>Peterson</i> cut the throat
of <i>Bonaventure Jelphs</i>, the Chief Mate; and
<i>Michael Moor</i>, at the Command of <i>Williams</i>,
shot him.</p>

<p>After this <i>Williams</i> came upon the Quarter-Deck,
and saluted <i>Gow</i> with Captain
<i>Ferneau&rsquo;s</i> sword, first striking it upon one
of the guns, and saying, <em>Welcome Captain
<span class="roman">Gow</span>, welcome to your new Command</em>. After
which, <i>Gow</i> told the men, That if any of
them durst murmur or cabal together, they
must expect to meet with the same Fate;
and then calling a Council, they agreed to
go, <em>Upon the Account</em>, as they called it.</p>

<p>They called the ship the <i>Revenge</i>, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg&nbsp;150]</a></span>
mounted six more of her guns, she being
able to carry four and twenty in all. But
instead of going to <i>Genoa</i> as intended, they
sailed for the coasts of <i>Spain</i> and <i>Portugal</i>,
in hopes of getting a ship laden with wine,
to keep up their spirits; but all was alike
they met with; and instead of wine, they
contented themselves with fish, which they
took out of a ship called the <i>Delight</i> of <i>Poole</i>,
<i>Thomas Wise</i>, Master, bound from <i>New-England</i>
to <i>Cadiz</i>, out of which they took
the men, and what they wanted, and then
sunk the Ship, to prevent their being discovered
to the <i>English</i> Men-of-War who lay
in the <i>Straights</i>.</p>

<p>On the 18th of <i>December</i>, they took the
<i>Snow-Galley</i>, out of which Crew they kept
<i>Rob</i>, and discharged the Captain and the
rest of the men, after having plundered
the Ship of the arms, ammunition, cloth,
provisions, sails, anchors, cables, and then
let her go.</p>

<p>By this time, they were got a great way
to the southward; and being in want of
water as well as wind, they agreed to go
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg&nbsp;151]</a></span>
to <i>Maderas</i>, which Island they made in two
days, cruising about it near a week, expecting
some vessel to come in or come out;
but the Country discovering what they were,
they were disappointed in their attempts.
Then they stood away for <i>Porto Santa</i>, where
they put up <i>British</i> Colours, and sent their
Boat ashore with a compliment to the
Governor, desiring leave to Water, and
buy some refreshments; which he readily
agreed to, and went with them to pay the
<i>English</i> Captain a Visit, who received him
in a very grand Manner. But the refreshments
not coming as expected, he at length
told him he was his Prisoner, and must
remain so till the provisions were come on
board, which was not till next day, when
<i>Gow</i> discharged him, giving him three
Cerons of Bees-wax, and three Guns at
his going away.</p>

<p>Having now got provisions, they agreed
to return to the Coasts of <i>Spain</i> and <i>Portugal</i>;
where they had not been above two days,
before they met with the <i>Batchelor</i>, <i>Benjamin
Cross</i> Master, from <i>New-England</i> bound to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg&nbsp;152]</a></span>
<i>Cadiz</i>; out of which they took <i>Cross</i> and his
Men, and gave the Ship to Captain <i>Wise</i>, as
also 24 Cerons of Bees-wax to him and his
mate, and to his four men 8 Cerons.
After this they took a <i>French</i> Ship from
<i>Cadiz</i>, loaded with wine, oil, and fruit,
which was what they wanted, and manned
her with their own men, taking on board
the <i>Revenge</i> the <i>French</i> Master, and his 12
Men, and most Part of the cargoe, with
five guns and their carriages, ammunition,
small arms, and sails, and gave the ship
to <i>Somerville</i>, Captain of the <i>Snow Galley</i>; and
to Captain <i>Cross</i> the <i>New-English</i> Man, to
who they gave half the ship and cargoe and
<i>Somerville</i> had all his Men, but <i>Alexander
Rob</i>, whom they detained, and who was executed
in 1725, for engaging along with them.</p>

<p>Soon after they saw a large ship to the
windward bearing down upon them, which
at first they thought to have been a <i>Portugueze</i>
Man-of-War; but they found afterwards,
it was a <i>French</i> Merchant Ship
coming home from the <i>West-Indies</i>, which
not fearing them, came on to the windward.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg&nbsp;153]</a></span>
<i>Gow</i> perceiving she was a Ship of great
strength, called all his men together, telling
them they had a great many prisoners on
board, and that he could not trust many of
his own men; besides, six of his best Hands
were on Board the other Ship, therefore he
advised them not to meddle with her, she
being far superior in Force. This so exasperated
<i>Williams</i>, that he demanded of
<i>Gow</i> to give his orders for fighting; but
he, by the advice of the whole crew,
declined it; whereupon <i>Williams</i> snapt his
pistol at his Face; which not going off,
made him still madder. <i>Winter</i> and <i>Peterson</i>
standing by him fired each a Pistol at
<i>Williams</i>, one shooting him through the
arm, and the other in the belly; at which
he fell, and they believing he was killed,
were going to throw him overboard, when
he leapt up, and ran into the Powder-Room,
with his pistol cocked in his hand, swearing
he would blow them all up; which he
had certainly done, had they not prevented
him that very moment, he having opened
the scuttle to do it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg&nbsp;154]</a></span>
They immediately put him in irons, and
hand-cuffed him, and then put him between
decks, in a place prepared for prisoners.</p>

<p>Two days after this, they took the
<i>Triumvirate</i>, a <i>Bristol</i> Sloop, <i>Joel Davis</i>
Master, bound from <i>Newfoundland</i> to <i>Oporto</i>,
with fish; from whence they took all her
provisions, arms, sails, and two of her
men, and then let her go with the rest,
and all her cargoe. Not knowing what to
do with <i>Williams</i>, they resolved to put him
on board them, and send him away, for fear
of further danger, ordering the Master to
put him on board the first <i>English</i> man of
War he should meet with, to hang him for
Piracy; which when <i>Williams</i> found they
were resolved to do, he made all the submission
he was able to Captain <i>Gow</i>, begging
for pardon, knowing if he was carried to
<i>Lisbon</i> he should meet with his deserts. But
all his entreaties would not do, he was brought
up double fettered, when he begged they
would throw him into the sea, and drown
him, rather than give him up to be hanged
in chains, which he knew he deserved from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg&nbsp;155]</a></span>
the <i>Portugueze</i> as well as <i>English</i>. This made
many of them begin to relent and pity him;
but considering his savage disposition, they
knew there was no safety to keep him on
board, and so resolved to let him go, and
give him a hearty curse at parting, wishing
him a safe voyage to the gallows, not dreaming
that they themselves should accompany
him.</p>

<p>The <i>Bristol</i> Captain obeyed their orders,
and as soon as he came to <i>Lisbon</i> put him
on board the <i>Argyle</i> man of War, Captain
<i>Bowler</i> Commander, who brought him home
not above three days before Gow and his
Crew came to keep him company.</p>

<p>In the middle of last <i>January</i>, they arrived
at <i>Caristoun</i> in the Isles of <i>Orkney</i>, when <i>Gow</i>
gave them instructions, what account they
should give of themselves to the people of
the country, to avoid suspicion. But now
began their misfortunes, for several of their
men began to think of making their escape,
the first was one <i>Read</i>, who took an opportunity
to get away when the boat went
ashore, who went to a farm-house which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg&nbsp;156]</a></span>
lay under a hill where he hired a horse
and rode to <i>Kirkwall</i>, a market town about
twelve miles off, where he informed them
what they were; whereupon they raised
the Country to defend themselves. The
Pirates soon hearing what was done, ten
more of them went away with the longboat,
making the best of their way for
<i>Scotland</i>, who were some time after taken in
the <i>Frith</i> of <i>Edinburgh</i>, and made Prisoners.</p>

<p>This so provoked <i>Gow</i>, that he resolved
to plunder the Country, be the consequence
what it would, and in order thereto, he sent
<i>Belvin</i> his Boatswain, with <i>Rob</i> and Four
more, to Mr. <i>Honnyman&rsquo;s</i> house, the Sheriff,
who not being at home, his Servants let
them in, not suspecting their design. They
immediately fell to work, but Mr. <i>Honnyman&rsquo;s</i>
Daughter had the presence of mind
to hide the money in a tub of feathers, till
she found an opportunity to carry it away,
by the contrivance of <i>Alexander Rob</i>, who
was placed centinel at the door. But when
the Boatswain found the treasure was gone,
Gow having before told them where it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg&nbsp;157]</a></span>
lay, he swore he would burn the house, and
all that was in it, which the young Lady hearing,
she runs to the Charter-room where the
Treasure lay, and threw it out of the Window,
jumping herself after. However, they plundered
the house of about fifty pounds, and
some plate, and then forced a servant who
played on the bag-pipes, to pipe before them
to the ship, whom they also detained, and
was brought along with them to the <i>Marshalsea</i>,
where he was sick till his release.</p>

<p>The next day they weighed anchor, and
came to <i>Calf-Sound</i>, where the boatswain
went ashore again with four armed Men,
meeting with no Plunder. From thence
they went to the Island of <i>Eda</i>, to plunder
the house of Mr. <i>Fea</i>, whom <i>Gow</i> had
formerly been School-fellow with, and
knowing him to be a Man of Courage,
believed that the Alarm at <i>Caristoun</i> had
drawn him thither: But Mr. <i>Fea&rsquo;s</i> wife at
that Time being very sick in Bed, kept him
at home, and having notice of them he
sent a letter to <i>Gow</i> by <i>James Laing</i>, to
desire him to withdraw, assuring him that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg&nbsp;158]</a></span>
most of the inhabitants were fled to the
mountains on the report of his being a
Pirate, desiring him to send the messenger
safe back, at whose return the affrights of
the people would be over. <i>Gow</i> sent him
word back, that he would write to nobody,
but if Mr. <i>Fea</i> would send his men with a
Boat, he would reward them handsomely,
which Mr. <i>Fea</i> hearing, he ordered his great
Boat to be staved, and sunk, and the sails
to be carried out of sight. In the mean
time, perceiving <i>Gow&rsquo;s</i> boat come on
shore, with five men in it, well armed, he
met them, and said if they would go to a
Publick House in the neighbourhood, and
take a cup of ale with him, he would see
what he could do to serve them, which they
agreed to, seeing Mr. <i>Fea</i> was all alone, not
suspecting any danger. Mr. <i>Fea</i> had before
given orders for half a dozen men, well
armed, to lie in ambush to surprize them,
which being done, Mr. <i>Fea</i> sent to Mr.
<i>Gow</i> to let him know, that the country was
alarmed, and that it would be his best way
peaceable to surrender, which <i>Gow</i> did in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg&nbsp;159]</a></span>
a day or two, thinking thereby to make
himself an evidence; but it would not do,
although he complied so far as to delude
all his men ashore one after another, who
would certainly have cut his throat, had
they known of any ways afterwards to have
escaped.</p>

<p>They were put on board the <i>Greyhound</i>,
which delivered them into the <i>Marshalsea</i>,
<i>March</i> 30, 1714, where they continued till
<i>June</i> following, when eight of them were
hanged at <i>Execution Dock</i>, viz. <i>John Gow</i>,
<i>James Williams</i>, <i>James Belvin</i>, <i>John Winter</i>,
<i>Peter Rawlisson</i>, <i>Daniel Mc.Cawley</i>, <i>William
Ingram</i>, for another Piracy under <i>Anstis</i>,
and a month afterwards <i>Alexander Rob</i>
was hanged for Piracy under <i>Gow</i>.</p>

<p><b>Transcriber's Note</b></p>

<p>Fraser notes in his foreword to this book that the original author's spelling was
"indefinite even for his own day", and adds that it has "has been more or less
modernized" in this edition; however, there are still many inconsistencies in
spelling, use of hyphenation and italics, and capitalisation of words. These
inconsistencies, along with archaic spelling, have been retained throughout.</p>

<p>Minor typographic errors in punctuation have been corrected without note.
The word 'with' was printed as 'htiw' (page <a href="#Page_138">138</a>),
and has been corrected. The word 'were' has been amended to 'where'
(page <a href="#Page_139">139</a>, "... where they sent several Hands ..."), for
the sentence to make sense.Two instances of transposed letters have also been
corrected&mdash;sieze changed to seize, and Goaler changed to Gaoler. The
original title page illustration also contained an error, Jnae, which referred
to a month. This was cross-checked with the rest of the text, and has been
amended to read June in the transcription of the text.</p>

<p>Gaps in page numbering were originally unnumbered blank, illustration, or
section title pages. The frontispiece illustration has been moved to follow
the front matter.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
